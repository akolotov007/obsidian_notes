Based on your requirements, here's a suggested architecture for your small bakery website:

**Frontend:**

* Framework: React.js (with Hooks and Router)
* Library: Tailwind CSS (for styling and layout)

For the frontend, we'll use React.js to create reusable UI components for each page. We'll utilize the following pages:

1. **Home Page**: A brief introduction to the bakery, with images and text.
2. **About Us**: A description of the bakery's history, mission, and team.
3. **Menu Page**: A list of menu items, each with its own details (name, price, description, etc.).

For the menu page, we'll create a separate component for each menu item, using React Hooks to manage state and props.

**Backend:**

* Framework: Django (Python)
* Database: PostgreSQL

For the backend, we'll use Django as our framework. We'll utilize its ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) system to interact with our database. For this project, we'll create a PostgreSQL database to store information about orders and menu items.

Here's an outline of the tables in our database:

1. **Orders**: A table to store information about each order, including:
	* `id` (primary key)
	* `date` (timestamp)
	* `total` (float)
	* `menu_item_id` (foreign key referencing the Menu_Item table)
2. **Menu_Items**: A table to store information about each menu item, including:
	* `id` (primary key)
	* `name`
	* `description`
	* `price` (float)
3. **Order_items**: A junction table to link orders with their corresponding menu items.

We'll use Django's built-in authentication system for user management and authorization.

**Checkout:**

For the checkout process, we'll create a separate view that handles the payment flow using your preferred API. We'll store the order data in our database, including the date, total, and menu item details.

**Additional Features:**

To consolidate information and make it easier to analyze, we can create additional features:

1. **Menu Item Statistics**: A view that displays statistics about each menu item, such as sales volume or average price.
2. **Order Analysis**: A view that analyzes order data by date, menu item, or total spent.

By using a structured approach like this, you'll be able to build a robust and scalable website for your small bakery project.
