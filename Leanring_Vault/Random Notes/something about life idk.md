## 1.Find a goal
- ### why have a goal?
	- humans have a drive to achieve something - to feel as though that they have a purpose.
	- if you have no purpose, you become stagnant
	- if you are stagnant, you will have quite the mental thoughts
		- "what if I'm not meant for this?"
		- "what should I do?"
		- "what am I going to live off of?"
		- "mom would be sad"
		- etc.
	- #### being stagnant will eat at you from within
		- one perspective I have on this:
			- you've been going to school for most of your life. You got used to doing the mundane work and forced into going through all of high school to reach the end. 
				- aka. you've been studying (doing something!) your whole life.**Your goals were dictated to you** for the most part (unless you wanted to be a top student or something)
		- now has come a point in your life were your ability to choose what you want to do is in your hands... but now what?
	- #### Finding a goal
		- you can have hobbies, interests, passions etc.
			- but what are you good at (or can become good at) that you can do as a job?
				- remember, you can always learn practically anything off the internet and that your **brain capacity is limitless** (a book by the same name, recommend it)
			- don't think in only strict terms of subjects - also include the more undefined skills like:
				- focus (how long)
				- consistency
				- communication skills
				- managing (your time, people, projects etc)
					- *yes you may not have any professional exp. but I'm sure you've played enough games to get an idea on this*
			- **look up hard skills and soft skills**
		- ask yourself:
			- do you like talking to people and helping them find what they need?
			- do you like being a leader and guide a team?
			- do you want to work on projects by yourself or with a small group?
				- *for understanding what position might fit you*
		- as well as:
			- are you more creative or logistical?
				- maybe a balance of both, but which side do you lean on?

## 2. A reason for being
- the Japanese created a very simple concept: **Ikigai**
	- [venn diagram of ikigai](https://imgs.search.brave.com/Ye5ZVNJWusKiWDbXw_PbNKACxmbcm4BnuO8dnqZ0lPk/rs:fit:500:0:0:0/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly9pbWFn/ZXMuc3F1YXJlc3Bh/Y2UtY2RuLmNvbS9j/b250ZW50L3YxLzVh/ZmJhZTFkYWE0OWEx/YTg2NDE3YzYwZS8x/NTUyOTQ1NDk4MTk1/LU0zODlISUlYNEVR/SFgxR1BVT1o1L2lr/aWdhaS1ncmFwaGlj/LmpwZw)
- I don't have much to say about the concept as it describes itself 
- what I will say - **a reason for being is greater than just a single goal**
	- this reason may change over time, as you do too
	- you won't find it in a day, or a year. 
- **in pursuit of finding your ikigai, you must continue on finding yourself**
	- finding:
		- what you like
		- what you hate
		- who you are 
			- what kind of person are you?
		- your honest thoughts on the world
		- your beliefs
		- etc.

## 3. Self Improvement
- ### What does that even mean?
	- dictionary definition - the improvement of one's knowledge, status, or character by one's own efforts
		- #### Status
			- what your known by, without ever meeting you
			- aka you reputation precedes you 
		- #### Knowledge
			- what do you know?
			- knowledge leads to wisdom through intelligence
			- [https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/knowledge-intelligence-wisdom-know-differences-peter-bilodeau] 
		- #### Character
			- what people of you
- #### Why should you work on self-improvement?
	"No man has the right to be an amateur in the matter of physical training. It is a shame for a man to grow old without seeing the beauty and strength of which his body is capable."  - *Socrates* 
	- I think about this quote sometimes... and I think that in its essence it also applies to every other part of you - not just your physical 
		- **to become your best self** 
- ###### No matter who you are in life, you can always strive in becoming your best self
	- My opinion: It is an ideal. In my eyes, I view the word ideal as something that is unattainable - look at its definition.
		- an ideal is something to strive for and to ultimately get closer to.
			- *really simple example for the sake of explanation*
				- Christians believe in Jesus and follow his teachings
				- They know that they'll never be like Him, but they strive to be better versions of themselves by following Him and his teachings.
- #### Belief systems
	- "Belief systems are complex networks of interconnected ideas, concepts, and assumptions that individuals use to make sense of the world and their place within it. They are deeply personal and often shape an individual’s understanding of reality, morality, and values." - AI 
		- aka, its deeply rooted into you and how you view the world and how you traverse it
- You already have beliefs, its only a matter of whether you know them or you don't
	- ##### its important to understand your beliefs
		- **1. Know yourself**
			- its good to know who you are - it is your foundation 
		- **2. Know others**
			- what I mean is that once you can understand yourself, you can understand others. 
		- **3. Compatibility**
			- the different relationships of your life (at work, friends, partner) will be greatly influenced by beliefs.
				- ##### Agree to disagree 
					- you will meet people that you will disagree with. Its the world
					- **Knowing the other side(s) that counter of your belief is of utter importance**
						- Don't be an ostrich. Knowing them will help you a lot
				- ##### Agree to agree
					- finding someone who agrees on your beliefs... I think you can understand the benefit of that. 
## 4. Discipline and Consistency 
- ##### Motivation 
	- 
	- An amazing feeling if it hits the right spot.
	- **comes and goes throughout your life**
		- its like a quick start boost; you can't ride off a boost the whole race
- #### Discipline
	- **controlling your behavior**
		- self control over preventing obstacles:
			- distractions
			- bad habits
			- procrastination 
			- excuses
- #### Consistency
	- **one's behavior over time**
		- self control over a habit(s) in the long term
			- focus 
			- good habits
			- precrastination 

- [Referenced Text](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-discipline-and-consistency)
- #### All 3 go hand in hand
	- one leads to another. Motivation can come in any part of the cycle, from the very beginning when you decide to start, all the way down the line when you've been doing it for 3 years.
- 
## 5. Enough theory
- "The world keeps turning even if your not with it. The world doesn't wait for you" - I
	- shit happens, it is what it is
		- I'm happy for you 
		- I'm so sorry to hear that 
		- That's amazing! 
- Here I'll tell some stories about myself - while you think about all of this
	- ###### A. I'm not that much further than you
		- I'm 20, finishing my AA degree. Community college flew past me, and I can't say that I learned anything that I remember right now.
			- there were some small fun memories, but that's on me for not making more
	- ###### B. I've just been thinking about this for a longer time
		- I got interested about the world and how people think back around 6/7th grade. while at the time I didn't know the official terms of what I was interested in, it became apparent as time went on. I talked and talked with friends and people, reading books that I could find on the internet, watch youtube videos - the likes.
		- Now.. now I haven't looked into it any deeper. I stopped about 3 years ago, as it slowly fell off. 
			- I should get back into it, because it thrilled me to connect the dots in life, and there are millions to connect.
	- ###### C. What are my goals?
		- they aren't concrete, but I said that I'll do something in cybersecurity. 
			- I like the concept of hacking and protecting 
				- looking deeper, I like having that kind of control of info and knowledge of protecting it. being useful
					- *reference to finding what it is that you like*
		- I also want to make money, like an entrepreneur would.
	- ###### D. An eternity in paralysis by analysis 
		- I probably won't hear the end of this phrase in my life, and I don't mind it
			- "you overthink"
				- It's just my honest interest I say
			- Con:
				- with a million options, you eventually try to find the best route to your goal
			- Counter:
				- Super simple counter to overthinking.... just fucking do it
					- [20/80 rule](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/80-20-rule.asp)
						- 20% of all inputs (or causes) result in 
						- 80% of all outputs (or outcomes)
					- meaning that you don't need that much information to start - and to get ahead
					- I think I listened on youtube how a big business owner makes decisions:
						- he said something that he gets just the necessary amount of information - and nothing more - in order to make a decision 
## 6. Now start doing something
- find books to read
- go touch the grass outside
- go to sleep
- eat some food
- etc.

- whatever is in your control, you control. Whatever isn't in your control, don't worry about it.
	- make the best of your situation 
		- if you have to move, move
		- if you have to run, run
		- if you have to sit and wait, sit and wait
- the steps you take are all dependent on you - not anyone else
	- you will hear it from anyone - that you shouldn't do this or that in life
		- listen, analyze, (think, duh) and decide
