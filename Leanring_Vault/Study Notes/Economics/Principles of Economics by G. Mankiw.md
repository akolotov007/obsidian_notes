# Part I : Introduction

- Scarcity - the limited nature of society's resources
- Economics - the study of how society manages its scarce resources

## Ten Principles of Economics
### 1. People Face Trade-Offs
- an hour on studying trades off an hour of playing
- a dollar allocated to tuition, trades off a dollar for retirement

**Efficiency** - a property of society, getting the most it can from its scare resources
**Equality** - the property of distributing economic prosperity uniformly among the members of society.

**Efficiency vs Equality**
- These 2 goals can conflict...
- efficiency refers to the size of the economic pie, while equality refers to how evenly the pie is sliced.
- when the government cuts the economic pie into more equal slices, the pie sometimes shrinks. (bc efficiency refers to the pie's size )

### 2. The cost of Something is what you give up to get it
**opportunity cost** - whatever must be given up to obtain something

consider attending college, you get intellectual enrichment, but what is the cost?
- maybe cost of books, classes etc
- how about a place to sleep and eat?
- what about your largest cost of going to college - time
- 


### 3. Rational People Think at the Margin
**Rational people** - people who systematically and purposefully do the best they can do to achieve their goals
- economists often assume people are rational.
	- although human behavior is complex, and deviates from rationality, good starting point
**marginal change** - an incremental adjustment to a plan of action 
- small adjusts around the edges of what you are doing

Example:
if airplane ticket costs $500, but 10 empty seats before takeoff, last minute passenger wants to pay $300 for a seat, should airline sell it?
- yes, since adding 1 more passenger is tiny.
The **average** cost of flying a passenger is $500, but the **marginal** cost is merely the
cost of the can of soda the passenger will consume and the small bit of jet
fuel needed to carry his weight.


*A rational decision maker takes an action if and only if the action’s marginal benefit*
*exceeds its marginal cost.* 

This principle explains why people use streaming services
as much as they do, why airlines sell tickets below average cost, and why people pay
more for diamonds than for water.


### 4. People respond to Incentives
**Incentive** - something that induces a person to act 

many policies change the cost or benefits that people face, and alter their behavior.
- a high gas tax encourages people to drive fuel-efficient cars, carpool, take the bus and live closer to work.

When analyzing any policy, it is important to consider not only the direct effects but also the indirect effects that work through incentives. If the policy alters incentives, people may change their behavior.
- if enforcing wearing seat belts (law),
	- accidents are less costly by reducing risk of injury or death.
	- people drive faster and less carefully in ideal conditions
	- resulting in more accidents 
- the seat belt law adversely affects pedestrians 
	- who are more likely to have accident, but not the added protection from seat belt


### 5. Trade Can Make Everyone Better Off 
consider US and China trading competitors.
- although both are competing for customers in various markets, trade between 2 countries can make each country better off.

for example, consider how families compete against one another.
- if one is looking for a job, they are competing against someone else for that job
- in a sense, each family in an economy competes with all other families. 

if no competition existed, each family would have to grow its own food, make their own food.
- trade allows everyone to specialize in activities they do best, and allows buying of goods and services at a lower cost



### 6. Markets are usually a good way to organize economic activity 
**market economy** - an economy that allocates resources through the decentralized decisions of many firms and households as they interact in markets for goods and services 

- In Communism and Soviet Union, many countries operated on the premise that the government officials were in the best position to allocate the economies resources.
	- theory behind central planning was that the government needed to organize economic activity to ensure the well being of countries. 
	- that then shifted to a **market economy** once the Soviet Union collapsed

prices are the instrument with which the *invisible hand* directs economic activity.
- buyers and sellers come to an agreement on what the prices are for something.

 prices adjust to guide market participants to reach outcomes that (in many cases) maximize the well-being of society as a whole.

"Give me that which I want, and you shall have this which you want, is the meaning of every such offer." - *Adam Smith*


### 7. Governments can sometimes improve market outcomes
what is the role of the government in an economy?
- one reason is the government *enforces rules* and *maintains the institutions* that are key to the market economy.
	- market economies need institutions to enforce **property rights**
		- **property rights** - the ability of an individual to own and exercise control over scare resources

another reason is that - although the invisible hand isn't omnipotent
- 2 broad rationales for the gov to intervene in the economy and change allocation of resources
	- a. to promote efficiency   
	- b. to promote equality 

##### To promote Efficiency 
**market failure** - a situation in which a market left on its own does not allocate resources efficiently 

**externality** - the impact of one person's actions on the well-being of a bystander
- example: when a market produces good but pollutes, that would be considered an externality  

**market power** - the ability of a single economic factor (or small group of actors) to have substantial influence on market prices 
- example: if everyone needs water but there is a single well (and a single owner), the owner can restrict the output of water and charge a higher price.

##### To promote Equality
- the invisible hand leaves large disparities in well-being:
	- does not ensure that everyone has enough food, decent clothing, and adequate healthcare.

To say that the government **can** improve market outcomes does not mean it **always** will. 
- as you learn economics, you will be better able to justify 

###  8: A Country’s Standard of Living Depends on Its Ability to Produce Goods and Services
**productivity** - the quantity of goods and services from each unit of labor input 

- most all variation in living standards is attributable to differences in countries’ **productivity** 
- simply put, the growth of nations' productivity determines the growth rate of its average income.

if productivity is considered main determinant of living standards:
- implies other explanations are lesser.
	- eager employers, labor unions, etc.
- some comment how US has decreased its speed of growth bc of increased international conflict.

When thinking about how any policy will affect living standards, the key question is how it will affect the economy’s ability to produce goods and services.
- the best tools, the best training, the best tech

### 9. Prices Rise When the Government Prints too Much Money
**inflation** - an increase in overall level of prices in the economy 
- main reason - growth in quantity of money 

in 1970, US saw inflation bc of the rapid growth of the quantity of money, and in 1980 inflation dropped due to the slowing of the quantity of money

In 2022, US inflation was surging, consumer prices were 7.9% higher than last year, the highest in 40 years.
- It is a question whether this inflation would be transitory, as many gov officials believe, or whether the inflation surge would be embedded in the economy




### 10: Society Faces a Short-Run Trade-Off between Inflation and Unemployment
while increase in quantity of money primarily raises prices in long-term, short term is more complex.

##### short term effects are as follows:
- increasing the amount of money in the economy stimulates the overall level of spending and thus the demand for goods and services.
- Higher demand will, over time, cause firms to raise their prices, 
	- but in the meantime, it encourages them to hire more workers and produce a larger quantity of goods and services.
- More hiring means lower unemployment

this line of reasoning leads to the trade off between inflation and unemployment
- most accept, some speculate on this

Over a period of year or two, many economic policies push **inflation** and **unemployment** in opposite directions.

**business cycle** - fluctuations in economic activity, such as employment and production


## Thinking like an economist
### The Economist as a Scientist 
- Many are not accustomed to looking at society through a scientific lens.
#### The Scientific Method: Observation, Theory, and More Observation
- as newton saw an apple fall and wanted to devise a theory for it
	- an economist who lives in a country with rapidly increasing prices would devise a theory of inflation 
- challenge for economists: cannot create experiments 
	- have to work with data that exists in the world 

#### The Role of Assumptions
- Assumptions can simplify the complex world and make it easier to understand. 
	- To study international trade, for example, we might assume that the world consists of only two countries and that each country produces only two goods.
#### Economic Models 
- economists also use models to learn about the world - diagrams and equations
	- models omit many details, allows to focus on big picture by simplifying the reality 

#### Our First Model: The Circular Flow Diagram
- **circular flow diagram** - a visual model of the economy that shows how dollars flow through market among households and firms 
	- 2 decision makers:
		- **firms**
			- produce goods and services using inputs, such as labor, land and capital (buildings and machines) 
			- **factors of production**
		- **households**
			- own the factors of production and consume all goods and services that the firms produce
- household and firm interact in 2 types of markets
	- **market for goods and services**
		- households are *buyers*, and firms are *sellers*. Specifically, households buy the output of goods and services that firms produce.
	- **markets for the factor of production**
		- households are *sellers*, and firms are *buyers*. In these markets, households provide the inputs that firms use to produce goods and services


![[Pasted image 20241202174017.png]]
- dollar in wallet, going to coffee shop
- dollar in register, revenue of firm 
- firm spends on inputs in the markets for factors of production
- eventually dollar returns to some household and back into wallet

#### Our Second Model: The Production Possibilities Frontier 
- **Production Possibilities Frontier** - a graph that shows the combinations of output that the economy can possibly produce with the available factors of production and production technology.
	- shows the various combinations of output that can possibly produce given the available factors of production and the production technology that firms use to turn these inputs into output.

- for example if an economy only produces cars and computers, we can see the different possibilities of output
	- if economy uses all resources to produce 1000 cars, no computers.
	- if economy uses all resources to produce 3000 computers, no cars.
- economy will find balance in producing these 2 items,
	- 700 cars and 2,000 computers

![[Pasted image 20241202180246.png]]

an outcome is said to be **efficient** if the economy is getting all it can from the scare resources it has available.
- **points on the frontier line** represent efficient levels of production
- D is inefficient, and E cannot happen

Once economy reaches an efficient point, the only way to produce more of a product is to produce less of another 
- the opportunity cost of a car in terms of the number of computers is not constant. 

##### A shift in production possibilities frontier 
![[Pasted image 20241202181814.png]]
- a technological advance n the computer industry enables the economy to produce more computers for any given number of cars.
	- If the economy moves from point A to point G, the production of both cars and computers increases.

#### Microeconomics and Macroeconomics 
**Microeconomics** - the study of how households and firms make decisions and how they interact in market
**Macroeconomics** - they study of economy-wide phenomena, including inflation, unemployment and economic growth

- when economists are trying to explain the world, they are scientists. 
- When they are giving advice ...
