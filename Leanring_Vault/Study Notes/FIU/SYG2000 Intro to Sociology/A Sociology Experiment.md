## Chapter 1 A Sociology Experiment

### 1.1 What is Sociology?

**Sociology** - the study of how societies are organized and how the organization of a society influences the behavior of people living in it

**Sociological Imagination** -  the capacity to think about our own personal experience in relation to a larger set of social forces that influence every aspect of our lives, whether they are visible to us or not.

Much of early sociology was interested in how communities rapidly changed from contexts where people had to do most things for themselves - to communities where people relied on others to do almost everything for them. 

**The Industrial Revolution**  
- economic changes from the Industrial Revolution affected all aspects of our lives, leading to rapid social changes
- as ppl moved to cities they became dependent on one another 

**Division of Labor** - Economic arrangement in which workers, and even entire communities, specialize in particular tasks or products, rather than producing everything they need themselves

Group behavior is more than the individual decisions of each separate person
- Group dynamics and the setting change the decision-making process for the individuals involved.

Sociology overlaps with other discipline: political science, psychology, and economics.
- looking at how individuals and the social environment influence each other


### 1.2 Founder's of Sociology 
#### Auguste Comte (1798-1857)
- *personally added*
#### Karl Marx (1818-1883)
- One of the founders of socialism and communism
- spent most of his time writing about capitalism and the economic changes it brought

- Concluded that all societies are based on **social conflict** - a struggle between groups who have different interests and needs. 
	- basis of conflict: ownership and distribution of goods and resources 
- Argued that in order to understand any society, look at how things were made.

- changes to societies came about because of social conflicts over how things are made and distributed

##### Main Theory 
-  central conflict in an industrialist capitalist society is between two classes:  capitalists and workers.
	- **Capitalists** own important resources like factories and determine how workers do their jobs.
	- **Workers** - only truly own their own **labor**, they sell this to capitalists for **wages**

- Capitalists want more wealth for themselves, so they organize work in such a way that workers receive lower and lower wages.
- Workers want higher wages, and more control over the labor process - to be able to decide how they work. 
- this conflict defines the capitalist society from Marx's perspective.

- **alienation** - the feeling of being disconnected from others, from work and even from our own sense of humanity
	- suggested that one of the core problems with capitalism is that workers are alienated.
##### About Him
- **Relational Sociologist** - Instead of focusing on the properties and characteristics of individuals, he argued that individuals are defined by their *relationships* with others and with social institutions such as the economy.
	- being capitalist is a relationship that an individual is with others. 


#### Émile Durkheim (1858-1917)
- played a key role in development of *social science*
- insisted that study of society should follow rigorous rules and rely on data to test whether ideas about the world are correct

- Interested in Capitalism, focused on structural properties - forces that both impact individual behavior and are produced by that behavior

- Interested in society as a whole, and how people in a society are connected 
	- **Solidarity** - the patterns of connections
		- **Mechanical Solidarity** - older and simpler societies. Extremely cohesive, people highly integrated with one another.
		- **Organic Solidarity** - more complex societies. Some members are only distantly connected to one another, but members increasingly rely on each other

- **Mechanical** societies can give a person sense of purpose and place, more integrated into society
	- fragile in nature - remove one part and the society might not work anymore
- **Organic** societies can give a sense of uselessness; you're not necessary or important to the larger community
	- more resilient, less reliant on individual members. 

*What makes individuals feel essential makes societies fragile, and what makes societies robust makes individuals feel alone*

2 dimensions of society: 
- **Integration** -  how tied an individual is to others
	- too much integration - feel trapped in the group
	- too little integration - where you feel like you're alone, without connections to others
- **Regulation** - all groups have rules, both formal and informal
	- rules = **norms** , expectations for our behavior 
	- too little regulation = **anomie**
		- people do not have clear moral standards or social expectations to guide their behavior 
		- the less we feel integrated into community, and the faster the rules about acceptable behavior changes => leads to **anomie**

#### Max Weber (1864-1920)
- emphasized **methodological individualism**
	- argued in order to make sense of the world, it was often necessary to focus on the individual

- sociology : "a science concerning itself with the interpretive understanding of social action and thereby with a causal explanation of its course and consequences."
	- suggested sociology should look at **social action** - behaviors that produce structures
		- look at *causes* of **social action**
	- the understanding that sociologists generate is **interpretive**
		-  understand the subjective meaning of actions 
			- make sense of the meaning that individuals get from and assign to that behavior
 
- Where does capitalism come from?
	- Marx thought it emerged out of the previous economic system, *feudalism*
	- Weber look at subjective meaning of emergence of capitalism
		- **culture** - values that people hold and that ultimately guide their social actions
- Weber thought culture may have caused capitalism 
	- Marx thought capitalism caused culture 

### Review Sheet
#### Key People
- Karl Marx
	-  In Capitalist society, social conflict primarily btwn capitalists and workers 
		- capitalists want more profit, lower wages
		- workers want higher wages and better working conditions

### 1.3 An American Tradition : Expanding Sociology 

#### Jane Addams (1860-1935) 
- insisted on **socially-engaged scholarship** - the people she was working to help a fundamental part of her research practice.
	- scholarship was not about studying other people; it meant engaging with them and learning from that experience. 

- founded *Hull House*
	- place of social reform 
	- women could be educated, have support in raising children and engage in social activism 

- drew attention to problems experienced by women in cities, to child labor, to the struggles of laboring people, and to the moral obligation to eradicate poverty.


#### W.E.B. Du Bois (1868-)
- major contributions to American sociology, especially the relationship between slavery and capitalism
	- No other thinker considered race to be central to the social organization of human communities

- Slavery and Capitalism mutually reinforced one another.
	- black and white slaves were used for their labor
		- according to Marx, low-paid white workers should have united with enslaved people to overcome their oppression
- Du Bois argued that economic wages aren't the only factor that drives our behavior. **Race matters**
	- **Status** - relative social standing
		- a *psychological wage*
	- Southern families used racial inferiority to justify enslaving African Americans 
		- low paid white workers supported this myth bc they preferred the status of being White

1. Slavery and the growth of capitalism were interrelated
2. understanding social life requires looking at race relations
3. economics isn't necessarily the dominant value for people
	-  people value their status and receive psychological wages for holding a position above others in a status hierarchy, no matter how much they make in wages.


#### Review Sheet 
##### Key People
- Jane Addams combined the scientific study of poverty with social activism intended to improve the lives of the poor.
	- was in Hull House
	- one of the first researchers to focus on the lives of women and children 
- W.E.B. Du Bois was the first sociologist to seriously consider the role of race relations.
	- In a racist system, even poor Whites receive symbolic benefits from their Whiteness. As a result, they continue to support a system that ultimately benefits White elites the most.

##### Key Terms
 - **Hull House** – Founded by Jane Addams as a center for social reform to house, educate, and support poor women and their families. 
 - **Chicago School** – Influential group of sociologists at the University of Chicago who engaged in innovative research on cities and the patterns of how people live within them. 
 - **Socially-engaged scholarship** – Research that includes community members as researchers and data-gatherers and that focuses on their experiences. 
 - **Psychological wage** – Symbolic rewards Whites receive from a system that values Whiteness. 
 - **Status** – Our social standing relative to others.

## Chapter 2 Research Methods

### 2.1 Introduction

**Method** - a study design that allows us to systematically investigate the world and be relatively certain that we arrive at accurate conclusions
- Sociology is a social science, and a critical aspect of any science is that there are agreed-upon ways to generate knowledge

- Scholars find evidence that their conclusions are wrong 
	- the more times we try to show that our claim is wrong and can’t do it, the more comfortable we can be that our explanation is correct.

- **confirmation bias** - to look for and accept information that reinforces what we already believe
	- skepticism and considering other explanations help us avoid it 


### Research Ethics 
- Scientists haven’t always agreed on what makes research ethical, and don’t always design ethical research projects

- **Nuremberg Code** - outlined basic ethical principles for research on people
	- people must *voluntarily consent*
	- Researchers should avoid all unnecessary physical and mental suffering and injury to subjects
	- The degree of risk to subjects has to be justified by the likely benefit to humanity of the knowledge gained from the research
	- Subjects must be free to stop participating at any time
	- If researchers discover their project poses serious risks to human subjects, they must end the project immediately.


**Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment** - looked at how the symptoms of syphilis developed over time if left untreated.
- used poor black men as their subjects, 
- didn't tell them they had syphilis
- didn't tell them that there was a cure, penicillin 

**informed consent** -  means that all human subjects must be informed about the research project, including any likely risks, before they agree to participate. 
- For a participant to give informed consent, they have to fully understand the risks (and possible benefits) of the research.


### Review Sheet 
#### Key Points
- Methods allow us to systematically study the world scientifically, giving us more confidence in our findings. 
- An audit study showed that having been in prison hurt job applicants’ chances of being hired, even when they were otherwise similar to other applicants. 
- Skepticism is a key element of the scientific method; scholars constantly search for evidence that claims about the social world are wrong. 
- For research to be ethical, those who participate must take part voluntarily, must understand the risks involved, and must be able to stop at any time.
- The Tuskegee Syphilis Study shows how researchers can cause severe harm and even death if they don’t follow ethical research principles.

#### Key Terms
- **Audit study** – Research experiment in which researchers match participants on key characteristics. 
- **Method** – A systematic study design.
- **Confirmation bias** – Tendency we all have to look for and accept information that reinforces what we already believe 
- **Human subject** – Person who participates in a research study. 
- **Nuremberg Code** – First international guidelines establishing research ethics. 
- **Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment** – Long-term experiment on Black men in Alabama that demonstrates unethical research design. 
- **Informed consent** – Voluntary agreement to participate in research based on a full understanding of the potential risks and benefits.

### 2.2 Types of Research Methods
- data generally falls into 2 categories:
	- **Quantitative** -  *numbers*, quantities or amounts
	- **Qualitative** - other information that is generally used to describe something, *words*
		- transcripts from interviews, survey questions, detailed notes about a given place 
#### Five common sociological methods 
- **Experiment** - research method in which characteristics or behaviors are carefully controlled
- **Surveys** - a set of questions that subjects answer
	- relatively cheap and quick way to get lots of information
		- low response rates
		- wording issues 
- **participant observation** - the researcher spends time among a group, directly observing and participating in that social world 

- two related methods that involve analyzing existing sources (historical records, media stories, etc.) to find key themes 
	- **Historical analysis** 
	- **Content analysis** 

#### Choosing a method
- Every sociological study you read about was designed based on the skills, resources, and limitations that the researchers faced, as well as what method they thought would best get at their question. Instead of thinking of a study on its own, it’s helpful to think of it as one piece in a bigger puzzle, each contributing a small piece to completing the puzzle.

#### Review Sheet 
##### Key Terms
- **Quantitative data** – Data in the form of numbers that reflect amounts. 
- **Qualitative data** – Non-numerical data. 
- **Experiment** – Research method in which the environment is controlled to isolate the effects of one factor or characteristic. 
- **Survey** – Gathering data by asking people sets of questions. 
- **Participant** **observation** – Research method in which researcher spends time among a group, observing and participating in their daily lives. 
- **Historical analysis** – Analysis of existing historical records. 
- **Content analysis** – Analysis of existing sources, focusing on key themes and patterns.

### 2.3 Designing a Research Method

In general a research project follows several steps:
1. Choose research question
2. state your hypothesis
3. gather data 
4. analyze data
5. use analysis results to come to conclusions 

#### From topic to question 
- Once you’ve identified a research topic, you’re ready to turn that topic into a **research question**
	- research question has to have more than one possible answer or outcome ; identify the answer that seems the most accurate
- *Remember:* The logic of science is to try to find evidence that your claim is wrong, not to show that what you already believed about the world was right.

#### Variables 
- **unit of analysis** - what you actually want to observe
	- how people's income are influenced by their education (unit is individual people)
	- how democratic nations tax their citizens compared to those ruled by royalty (unit is nation)

- **Variable** - factor or characteristic that has more than one possible value.
#### Independent and dependent variables 
- The goal of research is to identify **co-variation** - relationship between variables 
- **Independent variable** - the variable you have control over which affects the *dependent variable*
- **Dependent variable** -  the variable that you are studying, *depends* on the *indep. variable*

#### From research question to hypothesis 
- **hypothesis** - a statement about how variables relate to one another 
	- The general form of an hypothesis:
		- For Population (P), Independent Variable (X) is related to Dependent Variable (Y)

- **Operationalization** - decisions about how to measure our variables

- Whenever doing research, there are multiple ways to choose to operationalize your variables
	- be clear about variables and how they are measured 
#### Selecting a sample
- **Sampling** - representatives of the given population
	- when sampling, have to decide how select a sample that truly represents the larger population 

- **Sampling Frame** - how you determine who will be contacted to be part of your sample

- When you draw conclusions from your study, strictly speaking, you can’t draw conclusions about the entire population. 
	- only draw conclusion about the group of people represented by your sampling frame

- **Random Sample** 
	- for sample to be random, each member must be known and have some chance of being selected
	- allows for **generalization** of conclusions
		- **Generalization** - apply your conclusions to the larger population outside the group that you studied

- **Non-Random Sample** 

- When selecting a sample, a serious concern is **nonresponse bias**
	- If people don’t respond in your research, is there reason why not?
	- if there’s a  reason why some people don’t respond and others do, you run the risk of drawing incorrect conclusions based on a sample that is biased in some way

#### Review Sheet

##### Key Points
- In general, a research project follows several steps: 1) choose a research question, 2) state your hypothesis, 3) gather data, 4) analyze data, and 5) come to conclusions about what you found. 
- Your variables are the factors you’re trying to explain. Your independent variable (X) is the characteristic you believe causes something; your dependent variable (Y) is caused by, or depends on, the independent variable. 
- When analyzing data, we’re looking for co-variation between variables. Our hypothesis is a statement of what we think the relationship between the variables will look like. An hypothesis includes a statement about the population, independent variable, and dependent variable. 
- **Operationalization** is a key element of research design. How you operationalize your variables will depend on what you’re trying to study. 
- **Random samples** allow us to study a small group and have it represent the larger population. Non-random samples may not allow us to generalize outside the study.

##### Key Terms 
- **Research question** –A question about a research topic that we can reasonably answer. 
- **Unit of analysis** – Item observed in a study (ex: individual people, cities, neighborhoods, apartment complexes, nations). 
- **Variable** – Any characteristic that has more than one possible value. 
- **Co-variation** – Relationship between variables. 
- **Independent variable** – Variable that causes a change in another.
- **Dependent variable** – Variable that changes in response to another.
- **Hypothesis** – Statement about how variables are expected to relate to each other. 
- **Population** – The entire group of interest in a study. 
- **Operationalization** – Defining variables into measurable items. 
- **Sampling** – Selecting representatives of the population to study. 
- **Ethnography** – In-depth study of a group and its culture.
- **Sampling frame** - Method for choosing which members of a population will be in a sample. 
- **Random sample** – A representative sample in which every member of the population has some chance of being selected.
- **Generalize** – Apply findings beyond the sample to the larger population. 
- **Non-random sample** – A sample in which not every member of the population has a chance of being selected.
- **Nonresponse bias** – Non-representativeness in a sample caused by patterns in who does and doesn’t respond.

### 2.4 Correlation and Causation

**Correlation** - a relation between variables 
**Causation** -  evidence that *independent variable* caused the change in the *dependent variable*

**Direction of the relationship** - which variable affects the other 
- We may think that X causes Y, but maybe it’s the reverse: Y could be causing X

-  **causal relationship** - a relationship in which causation exists
	- takes more work to demonstrate than a correlation

- it's possible there isn’t a true causal relationship between our variables, and we could be missing another hidden variable

- **spurious relationship** - when there is a connection between two variables but some other variable that hasn't been taken into account is affecting both the indep. and dep. variable
![[Pasted image 20250314124149.png]]
#### Validity & Reliability
- **Validity** -  
	- Random sampling and complex statistical analysis are pointless if it turns out that you weren’t actually measuring what you meant to be.

- **social desirability bias** - the tendency for subjects to give answers that they think are socially acceptable
	- In the U.S., most people are aware that it’s generally unacceptable to be racist. This means that even if people hold extremely negative views of certain racial or ethnic groups, they are very reluctant to identify as racist

**Reliability** -  the consistency of the measurements.


#### Review Sheet 
##### Key Terms
- **Correlation** – A relationship between variables. 
- **Causation** – One variable causes a change in another variable. 
- **Direction** of relationship – Which variable is affecting the other when a relationship exists. • Causal relationship – Relationship that includes causation between variables. 
- **Spurious relationship** – When a third variable actually explains the apparent connection between two variables. 
- **Validity** – Whether questions accurately measure the intended characteristic.
- **Social desirability bias** – Problems introduced to data when respondents give answers they believe are socially acceptable.
- **Reliability** – Consistency of measurements.


## Chapter 3 Social Structure and the Individual 

### Social Structure

**Social Structure** -   the boundaries people confront as they make decisions about their individual and collective actions
- limits the choices that people can make, but also enables some to have choices that other don't have

 - *Structural Boundaries* refers to:
	- **Rules** 
		- formal - dress code
		- informal - when greeting, kiss on check or shake hand?
	- **Resources** - things that are valuable or allow us to accomplish our goals
 
#### Statuses 
- **Social Statuses** - a person’s or group’s socially-determined positions within a larger group or society
	- ![[Pasted image 20250314132312.png]]

- 2 kinds of status: 
	- **Achieved Status** - (in part) from your own efforts
		- Occupation, level of education, class, and marital status are generally achieved statuses
	- **Ascribed Status** - assigned to you by society
		- without regard for your unique talents, efforts, or characteristics; this often happens at birth
		- race, ethnicity, sex, and age 
		- places people in *social hierarchies*
		- influence the resources society makes available to a person

- *Ascribed Status* such as race and sex are difficult to change, but social meanings can be transformed

- **Social Hierarchies** - ranking systems

- Seeing social status as a structural resource has a long tradition in sociology
	- Max Weber said that your social status is closely related to your **life chances**
	- **Life Chances** - or opportunities to provide yourself with material goods, positive living conditions, and favorable life experiences.
#### Roles
**Social Role** - a set of expectations about behavior and attitudes of people who occupy a particular social status
- Beyoncé is a singer, songwriter, dancer, actress, model, businesswoman, activist, philanthropist, parent, daughter, sister, and wife.
	- some fans like her for her music, while others for her political activism.
- Inconsistency between two or more of the roles we fill is **role conflict**

#### Groups 
- A **social group** consists of two or more people with similar values and expectations who interact with one another on a regular basis. 
	- We seek out groups to establish friendships, accomplish goals, and fulfill social roles

**norms** - the rules and expectations by which a group guides the behavior of its members
 - **normative** - behavior that meets these rules and expectations 

#### Networks 
- **social network** - a series of social relationships that links a person directly to other individuals (such as friends) and indirectly to even more people (for instance, friends of friends)
	- from social media, college alumni, or professional organization

#### Institutions
The final element of social structure brings together statuses, roles, groups, and networks.

**Social institutions** -  are enduring practices and rules (both formal and informal) that organize a central domain of social life.
- ex: mass media, government, the economy, family, the healthcare system, the education system.  


#### Review Sheet
##### Key Points
- Social structure plays a powerful role in shaping individuals’ lives as well as their access to valuable social resources. 
	- also provides a set of rules that people must navigate. 
- Social status is correlated with positive life chances and access to social rewards. 
- While it is difficult to change one’s ascribed status, the meaning of social statuses can be transformed. 
- Ascribed status can influence one’s achieved status. 
- Social groups and networks influence the behavior of their members. 
- Social institutions often reproduce the status quo, but they can also be avenues for social change.
##### Key Terms
 - **Social structure** – The set of social statuses, roles, groups, networks, and institutions that organize and influence the way people go about their lives. - 
 - **Resources** – Things which are valuable or allow us to accomplish goals. 
 - **Social status** – A person or group's socially-determined positions within a larger group or society. 
 - **Ascribed status** – Status assigned by society without regard for the person's unique talents, efforts, or characteristics. 
 - **Achieved status** – Status that results from your efforts. 
 - **Social role** – Set of expectations concerning the behavior and attitudes of people who occupy a particular social status. 
 - **Role conflict** – Inconsistency between two or more roles. 
 - **Life chances** – Opportunities to provide yourself with material goods, positive living conditions, and favorable life experiences. 
 - **Social group** – Two or more people with similar values and expectations who interact with one another on a regular basis. 
 - **Norms** – Rules and expectations by which a group guides the behavior of its members. 
 - **Social network** – Series of social relationships that link a person directly to other individuals and indirectly to even more people. 
 - **Social institutions** – Central domains of social life that guide our behaviors and meet our basic social needs.

### The Individual 
Would you be willing to give up a goal you have worked diligently toward in order to help out someone in need? What if that someone was an opposing player in a competition? Would you sacrifice your own success to allow them to succeed?
- These questions get at the issue of:

-  **agency** - our ability to act given the structural rules and resources that impact our behaviors
- **socialization** - experiences that give us an identity and teach us the values, morals, beliefs, ways of acting and thinking that are expected in our society
	- George Herbert Mead argued that our sense of self develops from our social experiences and interaction.
		- our identity is constructed through social influences.

**looking-glass self** - the way our perception of how others see us affects our sense of self. 
#### Agents of socialization

**agents of socialization** - individuals, groups, organizations, and institutions that influence your sense of self and help you learn how to be a member of society
- besides peer groups and school, family and mass media are two of the most significant agents

- We are also socialized to know our roles and statuses
	- Toys are also used to shape children’s gender identities, status, and roles. 
		- Boys are generally offered cars, trains, blocks, balls, action figures, and toy guns
			- mechanical, handy, athletic, and aggressive
		- Girls are given dolls, Barbies, dollhouses, and toy makeup. 
		- nurturing homemakers concerned with being physical attractive. 
	- Again, some parents challenge these gender norms by giving Lego blocks to girls and stuffed animals or dolls to boys, or buying gender-neutral toys such as board games.

When social expectations shift and we encounter a new set of group rules that guide our behavior,
 **resocialization** - process of adopting new social norms and identities.

Dramatic resocialization, greatly changing how we behave, what we think and how we view ourselves,
**Total Institutions** - groups of people are largely cut off from the wider society and their lives are controlled by the institution.
- Military boot camp, prisons, mental institutions, and religious training organizations

#### Review Sheet
##### Key Terms 
- **Agency** – Acting on your own will. 
- **Self-concept** – Thoughts and feelings we have of ourselves as physical, social, and emotional beings. 
- **Socialization** – Experiences that give us an identity and that teach us how to be members of society. 
- **Resocialization** – Socialization process by which we adopt new norms and identities. 
- **Total institutions** – Institutions that exert near-total control over members’ lives and engage in resocialization. Generalized Other – Values and norms of the larger culture that guide your actions. 
- **Looking-Glass Self** – The way our perception of how others see us affects our sense of self. 
- **Agents of socialization** – Individuals, groups, and organizations that influence your sense of self and help you learn the ways of being a member of society.


### Individual Agency and Social Structure 
- When we recognize the complex interconnection between agency and social structure we are exercising our **sociological imagination**
	- all of our actions shape the world in which we live. 
	-  the world shapes the actions we take. 

**Micro-sociology** - focuses on individual identities and small-scale interactions with others
- **Symbolic interaction** -  studies human interaction by focusing on the words and gestures that people use and the meanings they create about the world.
**Macro-sociology** -  takes aim at large-scale societal structures, including groups and institutions as well as social forces such as norms.

-  the unequal distribution of resources and opportunities across society, a macro-sociological phenomenon known as the **structure of opportunity**, shapes the choices individuals make

![[Pasted image 20250318135123.png]]


**reflexivity** - the process of evaluating our position in the social world, the rules we are expected to follow, and the resources we have or can acquire.

### Key Review
#### Key Points
- There is a dynamic interplay between individual agency and social structure. 
	- Our actions are constrained and enabled by social structural rules and resources. 
	- Our actions also contribute to the construction of society. 
- When deciding on a course of action, people take into consideration their social position, risks and rewards, structural rules, and available resources. 
- It is important to use both micro and macro sociological perspectives when we analyze individual choices and social structural changes. 
- Individuals make reflexive choices about how to act; those choices are influenced by social structural rules and resources.

#### Key Terms
- **Veiling** – Muslim practice of wearing a hijab or veil. 
- **Sociological imagination** – An understanding of the interplay between social structure and agency. 
- **Micro-sociology** – Analysis of individual identities and interactions. 
- **Macro-sociology** – Analysis of large-scale social structures and forces. 
- **Symbolic interaction** – The study of human interaction by focusing on the words and gestures that people use and the meanings they create about the world. 
- **Structure of opportunity** – The unequal distribution of resources and opportunities across society. 
- **Reflexivity** – Process of evaluating our position in the social world, the rules we are expected to follow, and the resources we have or can acquire.


## Chapter 4 Social Class, Inequality and Poverty

### Social Class
- **stratification** - a system that puts categories of people into a hierarchy.
	- Religion, gender, wealth, and race are common foundations for *stratification*, leading to unequal access to resources, political rights, and other benefits.

**Social class** -  is generally defined as a group of individuals who share a similar economic position based on income, wealth, education, and occupation.
- low, middle and upper class
- Most definitions of social classes are based on **income** - the total amount of money someone earns in a year
- another common indicator is **wealth** - the total amount of money that a person has if they sold off all their assets.
#### The social class structure of the United States

 We use Dennis Gilbert’s model of the class structure that relies primarily on *income, occupation, and education*.
 - doesn't factor in wealth, yet see how wealth is connected to these three factors
- 6 social classes within 3 broad categories
	 
	 - *privileged class* - made up of what he calls the capitalist class and the upper-middle class
		 - *capitalist class* - the 1%, make money from things they own: businesses, stocks, real estate, stocks. 
		 - *upper middle* - 14%, rely on high income jobs. Business manager, doctors, lawyers, accountants. rely on their salaries
	 - *majority class* - 60% population, evenly split btwn middle and working class.
		 - *middle class* - high school diploma, and some college experience, teachers, nurses, plumbers, electricians
		 - *working class* - completed high school or trade school, office support, retail sales workers, factory workers
	- *lower classes* - 1/4 of the population, working poor (15%) and underclass (10%), some education - most do not have more than a high school diploma
		- *working poor* - low wage jobs. cleaning services, manual labor, landscaping
			- don't have benefits, more likely to face financial insecurity and instability 
		- *underclass* - part time workers, unemployed. rely on public assistance benefits

#### Is social class ascribed or achieved?
- We are born into the social status of our parents, but that doesn't mean we stay in that social class

> There is a long-standing assumption that social class is largely an achieved status. Most people believe that your position in the social class structure depends mostly on your own individual efforts: are you motivated, do you work hard, do you make smart financial decisions, and are you willing to go the extra mile?
- it then points out how being born in higher social classes has its advantages, such as parents with higher incomes having more resources to help their children succeed academically.

#### Social mobility
**Social Mobility** - moving from an ascribed social class to a new social class 
- **Upward mobility** - from lower social class position to a higher one
- **Downward mobility** - from a higher social class position to a lower one.

#### Review Sheet 
##### Key Points
- Social class is a central concept in sociology. 
- Social class is often defined by a combination of income, wealth, education, and occupation. 
- The six social classes in Dennis Gilbert’s model of the class structure are the capitalist class (1%), upper-middle class (14%), middle class (30%), working class (30%), working poor (15%), and underclass (10%). •
- Research suggests that the American Dream is fading for many young people today; instead of enjoying social mobility, they will more than likely reproduce the social class position of their parents. 
	- Currently, only about 50% of children will earn higher incomes than their parents. 
- The idea that social class is achieved based on our own merit can be called into question when we consider the demographics of Fortune 500 CEOs. 
	- There were 37 women (7.4%) and 5 African Americans (1%) on the 2019 list of Fortune 500 CEOs.
##### Key Terms
 - **Social class** – Group of individuals who share a similar socio-economic position based on income, wealth, education, and occupation. 
 - **Stratification** – A system that puts categories of people into a hierarchy.
 - **Income** – Amount of money an individual earns from employment or investments. 
 - **Wealth** – Total amount of money that you have, or would have if you sold off all of your assets. 
 - **Capitalists** – Commonly known as the 1%; class that makes money from things they own such as businesses, real estate, stocks, and bonds. 
 - **Upper-middle class** – Well-educated individuals who typically have jobs as business managers, doctors, lawyers, accountants, and some small business owners. 
 - **Middle class** – Likely to have a high school diploma as well as some college experience; typically work as teachers, nurses, master craftspeople (plumbers, electricians, carpenters), and lower-level managers. 
 - **Working class** – Have probably only completed high school or a trade school; typically work as office support (secretaries and administrative assistants), retail sales workers, factory workers, and low-paid craftspeople. 
 - **Working poor** – Typically employed in insecure and low-wage jobs such as janitorial and cleaning staff, manual labor, landscaping, restaurant support (including fast food, wait staff, line cooks), and other service industries. 
 - **Underclass** – Work part-time, unemployed, or have inconsistent and unreliable work opportunities; often rely on public assistance to meet basic needs for food, shelter, and clothing.
- **Social mobility** – Movement from an ascribed social class position to a new achieved social class position. 
- **Upward mobility** – Movement from a lower social class position to a higher one. 
- **Downward mobility** – Movement from a higher social class position to a lower one.

### Inequality
- ![[Pasted image 20250320110401.png]]
	- the growing inequality between CEOs and workers
#### The growing gap between the poor and the rich
- Let’s begin with income inequality. We often hear that the gap between the rich and the poor is growing every year.
- ![[Pasted image 20250320110903.png]]
- Note that it isn't just income inequality, but also wealth inequality that is growing.
						![[Pasted image 20250320111042.png]]

the amount of wealth one has is strongly correlated with race and ethnicity:
![[Pasted image 20250320111307.png]]
- Keep in mind that 2 people could have the same income, but vastly different levels of wealth.
	- having some wealth makes it easier to get more of it.
	- 
**cumulative advantages** built up benefits and resources - allows people to increase their wealth

- *Thomas Shapiro* spent 20 years documenting the wealth gap between Whites and Blacks.
	- Blacks face high rates of poverty, mass incarceration and joblessness 
	- Whites have been able to pass on much more money to their children 
		- They didn't have to fight against segregation, systematically being oppressed by slavery, etc.

**racial wealth gap** - the difference in accumulated wealth between different races and ethnicities.
- as long as policymakers embrace the idea that social class is achieved, they will enact policies that reflect this belief and ignore the external factors that produce and perpetuate social inequality

When we look at the intersecting effects of race, gender, education, and income, we see quite clearly that not everyone enjoys the same path to financial success
- As much as we may want to tout our own individual efforts and accomplishments, there is no denying that some individuals are hampered by the persistence of racism and sexism in American society.

![[Pasted image 20250320112909.png]]

**meritocracy** -  a system where personal responsibility and individual effort are the sole determinants of success
- although many people have faith in this idea, decades of research shows that some individuals have it easier than others.

Rich parents spend a lot of money in order to position their children so that they can gain experience that impress elite colleges.
#### U.S. inequality in global context 
- How does the US compare to other countries?

**GINI Index** - a statistical measure used to compare inequality. 
- looks at how family income is distributed in a country. 
	- If everyone has the same income, therefore total equality then GINI score 0
	- If one person in the country has all of income, therefore total inequality then GINI score 1

- Among the 31 most developed nations in the world, the United States has the second-highest GINI index, behind only Chile. This ranking is based on after-tax income, not before-tax calculations. 

According to a report from Oxfam International, global levels of class inequality have reached astounding levels:
- The world’s 8 richest men have the same amount of wealth as the bottom 50% of the world’s population. 
- The richest 1% of the world’s population owns more wealth than the rest of the 99% combined. 
- The incomes of the poorest 10% increased by less than $3 a year between 1988 and 2011. During this same period, the incomes of the richest 1% increased by 182 times. 
- 7 out of 10 people live in a country that has seen a rise in inequality in the last 30 years. 
- Each of the 100 richest CEOs earns as much in a year as 10,000 people working in a garment factory in Bangladesh.

#### Review Sheet
##### Key Points 
- Median household income in the U.S. in 2018 was $61,937. 
- The gap between the very wealthy and the rest of the country continues to grow each year. 
- The income of most workers has remained relatively stagnant while the pay of CEO and others in the top 1% has skyrocketed. Since 1987, the average CEO has seen his (the CEO is usually a he) compensation increase 1,000%.
- The racial wealth gap continues to increase, with Whites on average having much more wealth than other racial groups.
- White individuals have been able to pass much more money onto their heirs than Black have because they have not been saddled with various types of discrimination. 
- In every category of educational attainment, men make significantly more than women, and Whites generally make more than people of color. 
- Global inequality is also increasing at an alarming rate, as more wealth is in the hands of fewer individuals. The richest 1% of the world’s population owns more wealth than the rest of the 99% combined. 
- Among the 31 most developed nations in the world, the United States has the second- highest GINI index, behind only Chile (a high GINI index represents greater inequality).
##### Key Terms
- **Cumulative advantages** – Advantages that are built up over generations and contribute to social class inequality. 
- **Racial wealth gap** – Drastic and growing difference in wealth accumulation between Black and White individuals. 
- **Meritocracy** – Belief that personal responsibility and individual effort are the sole determinants of success 
- **GINI Index** – Statistical measure used to compare inequality across countries.

### Poverty and Homelessness 
The Washington Post article featuring Desmond reports that 13 million working-age adults receive federal disability payments, an increase from 7.7 million in 1996. Rural America, including where Desmond lives, has experienced the fastest increase in disability rates.
#### What is poverty?
 **absolute poverty** - People without necessities of life such as food, shelter, and clothing 

**poverty threshold** - aka *poverty line* establishes the minimum income level that the federal government says is required to buy the basic necessities of life. 

**relative poverty** -  takes into account the relative economic status of people in a society by looking at how income is distributed

#### Characteristics of the poor

1. Household type
	-  If you are in a household headed by a single mother, you are much more likely to be poor than those in married-couple or single-father families.
2. Education
	- There is a high rate of poverty among adults who have not completed high school. People without high school degrees are more than six times as likely to be poor as those who have completed college.
3. Paid Work
	- Those with no income are substantially more likely to be poor than are those who earn even low incomes. The risk of poverty falls as someone’s attachment to the labor market increases. Put simply, working for pay (especially high pay) is a poverty-prevention tool
4. Disability Status
	- For people aged 18 to 64 with a disability, the 2018 poverty rate was 25.7%, which amounted to 3.8 million people living in poverty.39 The unemployment rate is high for individuals with disabilities. Even if their disabilities don’t prevent them from working, they may face transportation challenges getting to work or encounter employers who are hesitant to hire people with disabilities
5. Race
	- The poverty rate is approximately two times higher for African-Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans than it is for Whites and Asian-Americans. One factor in the racial poverty gap is unemployment; the groups with higher poverty rates all have higher unemployment rates than Whites and Asian-Americans. The economic impact of COVID-19 has been especially harmful to Black workers, who have been more likely to lose jobs during the pandemic.
6. Region
	- The South has the highest poverty rate, while the Northeast has the lowest. However, differences in poverty rates between regions are narrowing
7. Concentrated neighborhood poverty
	-  High-poverty neighborhoods are Census tracts where at least 40% of the population is poor. This concentration of poverty is significant in light of the various social problems that exist in high-poverty areas. Growing income inequality, and income segregation in neighborhoods as people of different classes are less likely to live in the same neighborhood, has exacerbated concentrated poverty
8. Child poverty
	- In 2018, 11.9 million children (those under 18 years old) lived in poverty; children represented 31.1% of all people in poverty. Poverty levels among children have remained high since the early 1970s. A racial disparity in child poverty rates has also existed for decades, with much higher poverty rates among African-American and Hispanic children than for White and Asian-American children. Poor children have been at risk of suffering food insecurity and housing insecurity caused by financial distress during the COVID-19 pandemic.

![[Pasted image 20250320123228.png]]
#### The working poor and the jobless poor
**working poor** - defined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics as people who spent at least 27 weeks (half of the last year) in the labor force but whose incomes still fell below the official poverty level
- the BLS report reveals the following characteristics:
	- More women than men are classified as working poor
	- Blacks and Hispanics are more than twice as likely as Whites and Asians to be working poor. 
	- Families headed by women are more likely to be poor than those headed by men. 
	- Families with children under 18 are more likely to be working poor than those without children. 
	- Married-couple families are less likely than families headed by a single parent to fall below the poverty level. 
	- Full-time workers are less likely than part-time workers to be working poor. 
	- People with higher levels of education are less likely to be working poor. More education means better access to higher-paying jobs. 
	- Low earnings and periods of unemployment are key factors in falling below the poverty line.

#### Homelessness
-  **homeless** -  lacking a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence.
- **point in time count** -  1 night estimates of sheltered and un-sheltered homeless populations ;  occur during the last week of January each year.

- Single individuals make up 70% of the homeless population; the remaining 30% are families. 
- When we focus on individuals experiencing homelessness on their own, approximately 70% are men. But when we look at homeless families, approximately 60% are comprised of girls and women.

**sheltered homeless** - people staying in emergency shelters, transitional housing programs, or safe havens
- account for 63% of the homeless population
**unsheltered homeless** - primary nighttime residence is a public or private place not designated for, or ordinarily used as, a regular sleeping space, such as the streets, vehicles, or parks
-  account for 37% of the homeless population 

- approx. 8% of people who are homeless are military veterans
- Approximately 25% of the homeless population experiences **chronic homelessness**
- **chronic homelessness** - someone with a *disability* who has: 
	- a) been continuously homeless for a year or more or
	- b) has experienced at least four episodes of homelessness in the past three years where the combined length of the homeless episodes is at least 12 months.

Martha Burt says there are 3 factors that increase the risk of homelessness:
1. structural factors
	-  changes in the housing market, employment opportunities, criminal justice policies, and institutional support for poor people and people with disabilities
2. individual characteristics
	- disabilities, mental illness, addiction, and a felony record
3. public policy
	- Effective policies can prevent homelessness and reduce the impact of structural and personal factors that place people at risk of homelessness

#### Review Sheet
##### Key Points
- Cultural capital, fields, and habitus conceptualize culture as a kind of exchangeable There are different ways to measure poverty; definitions can focus on the necessities of life, the relative economic status of people in a society, or the essence of being poor (such as the challenges and outcomes of being poor). 
- The official poverty threshold in 2019 was $25,926 for a family of two adults and two children. According to the Census Bureau, in 2018 there were 38.1 million people in poverty; 11.9 million children lived in poverty. 
- Poverty is not an equally shared experience. Type of household, level of education, disability status, and race are among the characteristics that put some groups at higher risk of poverty than others. 
- More than 10 million Americans can be categorized as working poor. More women than men are classified as working poor. Blacks and Hispanics are more than twice as likely as Whites and Asians to be working poor. Low earnings and periods of unemployment are key factors in workers falling below the poverty line. 
- More than 500,000 people currently experience homelessness in the United States. In 2019, one-fifth of people experiencing homelessness was children. 
- Policy approaches have shifted away from emergency services to a broader focus on preventing and reducing homelessness. Strategies increasingly focus on permanent housing solutions.

#####  key Terms
- **Absolute poverty** – Poverty measure that considers the basic necessities of life such as food, shelter, and clothing; those without these necessities are considered poor. 
- **Relative poverty** – Poverty measure that takes into account the relative economic status of people in a society by looking at how income is distributed. 
- **Poverty threshold** – Establishes minimum income level required to obtain the necessities of life. 
- **High-poverty neighborhoods** – Census tracts where at least 40% of the population is poor.
- **Working poor** – People who spent at least 27 weeks in the labor force but whose incomes still fell below the official poverty level. 
- **Homeless** – Person who lacks a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence.

- **Sheltered homeless** – People staying in emergency shelters, transitional housing programs, or safe havens. 
- **Unsheltered homeless** – People whose primary nighttime residence is a public or private place not designated for, or ordinarily used as, a regular sleeping accommodation (for example, the streets, vehicles, or parks).


## Chapter 5  Culture

**Culture** - everything we make and consume - our ideas, attitudes, traditions and practices 
- the the idea that symbolic and expressive aspects to social life are worth examining
	- the beliefs and values we hold, as well as the practices and activities we engage in

- *Émile Durkheim* allows us to think about how much of social life works via culture: he notes that **symbols** (material or immaterial objects that groups affix meaning to), deployed through **rituals** (routinized and highly important group activities), give a community its specific character.

### What is Culture?
#### Material culture vs. symbolic culture 
- **material culture** - physical goods, often placed in an economic system
- **symbolic culture** -beliefs, values, language

*Émile Durkheim* explains how symbolic culture shapes social life
- **collective representations** - how a set of images and words can represent a particular culture; the purpose, or function, is to create social order and cohesion.
#### High culture vs. popular culture 
- **high culture** - cultural goods made for and enjoyed by elite groups.
	- oil paintings, ballet, the opera, fancy cuisine, and the like. High culture was “fine art,” often hidden from the masses.
- **popular culture** - heavily produced and commercialized goods made for and consumed by a large audience
	- sometimes called *mass culture* or *low culture*

- The once clear lines between high and popular culture have become quite blurred. New media and technologies always challenge our notions of art and culture

#### Culture as values vs. culture as a way of life 
- Culture as a unified system of **values** (moral beliefs) and **norms** (rules and expectations by which a group guides the behavior of its members)
	- Culture in this way, bends our beliefs into actions


- A well-known example is the conversation around the “culture of poverty”
	- In the 1960s, Oscar Lewis studied Mexico and Puerto Rico, finding that the conditions of poverty there created a set of widespread values and norms.
	- The debate transformed into the perception that poor folks are poor due to their own habits and preferences, their own culture.

Research has since shown that poor Americans hold values that are similar to the wider American population, even among the homeless.
- *William Julius Wilson* found that:
	- high social isolation among urban African Americans living in areas of extreme poverty
	- changes in urban economies had led to declining employment rates for Black men and rising female-headed households
- But Wilson found the same values among this population as among wider American society, including a strong belief in marriage and a work ethic.

Studies of organizations illustrate how values and beliefs are rather stubborn.

Culture as values isn't the only way, culture as a way of life

**code switching** - adopting a set of informal rules and manners that are appropriate in a specific setting
- For example, some kids would embrace the slang, manner, and clothing of the street to avoid being ridiculed on their blocks, and then adopt the norms of middle-class culture at school in order to succeed in the eyes of their teachers

*Ann Swidler* offered an alternative understanding of how we practice culture in real life. Describes culture:  
- **cultural toolkit** - sets of beliefs, values, and attitudes that we learn to use in different situations
	- cultural tools that solve particular problems or help us in the specific situation we’re facing

Culture isn't a single system of beliefs and practices, it is a **strategic activity**: people making decisions about what might work best in a given situation
- Culture is continually practiced and repurposed in every interaction

In thinking about culture as both a set of *values* and a set of *practices*, it becomes a kind of paradox: 
- Culture exists outside of us as individuals, shaping our understandings of the world, yet it is also constantly remade and repurposed through everyday interactions

#### Review Sheet
##### Key Points
- Culture can be understood in a variety of ways, from a division between high and popular culture to analyzing the material and symbolic components of a cultural good. 
- Culture can be seen as a system of values and norms, whether at the macro-level of a society or at the more middle (or ‘meso’) level of an organization. 
- Culture can also be seen as a set of practices people use strategically that can change over time

##### Key Terms
- **Code switching** – Adopting a set of informal rules and manners attuned to a particular setting. 
- **Collective representations** – A set of images and words that represent a particular culture 
- **Cultural toolkit** – Using a stash of beliefs, values, and attitudes that we learn how to deploy based upon the situation at hand. • High culture – Cultural goods made for and enjoyed by elite groups. 
- **Material culture** – Physical goods, not necessarily essentials, often placed within an economic system. 
- **Norms** – Rules for group behaviors, informed by values, specifying appropriate and inappropriate activities.
- **Popular culture** – Heavily produced and commercialized goods made for and consumed by a large audience. 
- **Rituals** – Routinized and highly important group activities. 
- **Symbolic culture** – Aspect of culture that includes beliefs, values, norms, and language. 
- **Symbols** – Material or immaterial objects that groups affix meaning to. 
- **Values** –Moral beliefs.

### Culture is a Cycle 
#### The romantic image of an artist 
- Author James Baldwin once wrote that “perhaps the primary distinction of the artist is that he must actively cultivate that state which most men, necessarily, must avoid: the state of being alone.
	- artists are always part of a vast network of groups and institutions that shape every cultural object.

The artist is one part of a cultural cycle. In this section, we look at that larger circuit, which includes production, consumption, and remaking of culture.
#### How is culture produced? 
- Where do cultural goods come from, and under what conditions have they been made?

**culture industries** - The mass production of cultural goods through a vast system of people and organizations

Take country music as an example:
- Richard Peterson showed how macro-level arrangements (laws, tech), shapes innovations and standardize cultural production.
	- initially there was diversity and innovation in country music when many record labels competed..
	- until larger labels bought smaller ones, monopolizing the majority of country music, homogenizing the genre
		- **corporate consolidation** - the acquisition of smaller corporations by larger ones

New jobs emerge across the culture industries, too. The rise of fast food created new youth labor markets, as fast food restaurants provided part-time work for teenagers.
#### Consuming culture 
In colonial America, open displays of wealth were considered vulgar. People didn't show off material possessions or leisure time.

**conspicuous consumption** -  gaining prestige by exhibiting valuable cultural goods, which implies to others that you are wealthy.

Are we mindless consumers, or do we bend the meanings and uses of the cultural goods to our own purposes? 
- Sociology shows how audiences play a role in culture as much as producers do.
-  *the meaning of a cultural good is open to multiple interpretations* 
#### Subcultures 

**Subculture** -  a group that holds values and engages in activities that separate members from the wider society
 - Subcultures allow us to see how culture is remade
 - Subcultural activities may also be co-opted by popular culture


#### Review Sheet
##### Key Points
- Depending on whether you examine culture from the point of production or consumption, different issues emerge. Each perspective answers significant questions. 
- The production of culture perspective shows how culture is made and distributed by a wide array of groups and organizations, not just individuals. 
- Consuming culture is not necessarily a passive activity, but rather a thoughtful practice. 
- Subcultures and fan cultures engage in cultural refashioning, cobbling together symbolic and material culture and assigning them new meanings. •
- Subcultures can be coopted by popular culture, refreshing the wider cultural landscape.
##### Key Terms
- **Conspicuous consumption** – Gaining prestige by exhibiting valuable cultural goods. 
- **Corporate consolidation** – The acquisition of smaller corporations by larger ones. 
- **Culture industries** – A system of organizations that produce and distribute cultural goods (e.g., music, food, art). 
- **Subculture** – A group that uses alternative symbolic and material cultural goods to distinguish themselves from the wider society.

### How Culture Works
#### How culture creates inequalities 
- cultural differences can create inequality and affect social mobility.

 **Cultural Capital**  -  non-economic resources (knowledge, skills, behaviors) that are useful in a particular sphere of social life.
- Institutional capital - degree from a particular university 
- embodied cultural capital - your manner, style, ways of acting
-  objectified cultural capital - your clothes, material objects

**fields** -  contexts where a particular kind of cultural capital is exchanged, like a profession, a community, or a class of people

**habitus** - is our learned dispositions, a set of tendencies organizing how we see the world and act within it

Let’s look at schooling to understand how culture creates inequalities:
- The education system teaches and rewards a particular kind of cultural capital: that of the dominant, White, and middle- to upper-class culture.

#### How culture creates groups and boundaries 
**status** - the social designation of honor 
**status group** -  collection of people who share similar characteristics that a community has given a certain level of prestige

 **symbolic boundaries** -  the ways people separate each other into groups through traditions, styles, tastes, classifications

We know that culture “bridges”
- We make friendships and social ties through our taste in music or clothes, and we are able to maintain those connections through continued cultural activities

**Boundary Work** - Creating and maintaining symbolic boundaries to limit group membership and access to resources
- Somewhat paradoxically, boundary work—and even conflict—creates groups and solidifies group cohesion.
**cultural omnivores** -  People who differentiate themselves by knowing a lot about many different cultural fields

#### Review Sheet
##### Key Points
- Cultural capital, fields, and habitus conceptualize culture as a kind of exchangeable good, useful depending upon the context, and a kind of learned tendency towards seeing and acting in the world. 
- Culture can work as a bridge and a fence.
- Tastes help people to define groups based upon aesthetic or moral bases. 
- People distinguish themselves through a deep understanding of a particular facet of culture, but nowadays people also gain status with knowledge of a wide palate of cultural goods. 
- Culture can justify and reinforce inequalities.

##### Key Terms
- **Boundary work** – Creating and maintaining symbolic boundaries to limit group membership and access to resources. 
- **Cultural capital** –Non-economic cultural resources (e.g., knowledge, skills, behaviors) attuned to a particular sphere of social life. • Cultural omnivores – People who differentiate themselves by knowing a lot about many different cultural fields. 
- **Field** – A context of social relations (e.g., a profession, a community) where a particular kind of cultural capital is exchanged. 
- **Habitus** – A learned disposition, based within the particular social world a person inhabits.
- **Status** – The social designation of honor, either positive or negative. 
- **Status group** – Collection of people who share similar characteristics that a community has given a certain level of prestige. 
- **Symbolic boundaries** – Conceptual ways people separate each other into groups (e.g., traditions, styles, tastes, classifications)
### The Culture Jam
#### Culture jam as a mix
Culture moves, spreading beliefs and practices across groups. 
diffusion occurs often through conflict, war, migration, or trade and as culture crosses boundaries it changes and adapts.

**globalization** - When intercultural communication and the exchange of ideas and values reaches such an international scale, integrating political and economic systems

#### Culture jam as a problem 
**rationalization** - increased efficiency, predictability, and control


Multinational corporations are increasingly universal and inescapable, drowning out local ideas, beliefs, and traditions.

**cultural imperialism** - This imposition of a dominant group’s material and symbolic goods is called 
On the flip side of cultural imperialism, there’s:

**cultural appropriation** - when members of a dominant culture adopt the cultural goods (e.g., ideas, symbols, skills, expressions, intellectual property) of other groups ***for profit***
- This disconnects the product from the history and community from which it emerged, and reduces the chances that those groups can benefit from the culture they produce
#### Culture jam as a solution
**culture jamming** - the practice of raising awareness around issues of McDonaldization, corporate consolidation, and cultural imperialism through informal and often illegal guerilla (independent and unauthorized) marketing campaigns.

**global commodity chain** -  international production, distribution, and marketing system of corporations, laborers, and consumers 
- Few people have any idea where their products come from, leaving most consumers unconcerned by the gross inequalities between them and the laborers on the other side of the system.

#### Review Sheet 
##### Key Points 
- Culture is a mixture of various beliefs and practices, but a sociological perspective requires thinking about how history and social dynamics play a powerful role. 
- There are obvious and hidden consequences of a globalized culture. While Western culture “localizes” itself (e.g., McDonald’s Maharaja Mac), such examples can obscure deeper cultural imperialism and inequalities. 
- Artists and activists can counter and critique mass culture at various stages of the cultural cycle.

##### Key Terms 
**Cultural appropriation** – Members of a dominant culture adopting cultural goods (e.g., ideas, symbols, skills, cultural expressions, intellectual property) of other cultural groups for profit.
**Cultural imperialism** – Imposition of a dominant group’s material and symbolic culture onto another group. 
**Culture jamming** – Efforts to raise awareness around issues of hegemony through informal and often illegal guerilla marketing campaigns. 
**Global commodity chain** – International production, distribution, and marketing system of corporations, laborers, and consumers. 
**Globalization** – Integration of political and economic systems; has brought about intercultural communication and an exchange of ideas and values. 
**McDonaldization** – Ritzer’s term for the increased rationalization and globalization of culture. 
**Rationalization** – Weber’s term for capitalism’s trend toward increased calculability, efficiency, predictability, and control.


## Chapter 6 Gender and Sexuality 

**Transgender** - refers to people whose gender identity and expression are different from what they were assigned at birth 
**non-binary**  - not exclusively masculine or feminine
**cisgender** someone whose gender matches the sex they were assigned at birth

### Sociological Perspectives of Gender

#### Nature, nurture, neither?
**Sex** -  different biological and physiological characteristics of males and females, such as reproductive organs, chromosomes, and hormones. 
**Gender** -  refers to the socially- constructed characteristics of women and men – such as norms, roles, and relationships among and between groups of women and men.

**nature** - biological influences
**nurture** - referring to social ones

**Socialization** -  learning about gender from family, peers, teachers, coaches, and other influential people in our lives
- boy's having the color blue associated to them, and girls the color pink

**gender norms** -  social definitions of behavior assigned to particular sex categories
- can and do change through time, place, and context - they are socially-determined and socially-enforced.
#### Social construction of gender 

**social construction of gender** - refers to how meanings of gender are created through social interaction and social norms
 - Teaching, learning, performing, and policing gender behavior in light of expectations of appropriate conduct are also part of the ongoing process of social construction

>Here’s another example: have you ever heard someone speak and noticed that the person raises his or her voice at the end of each sentence, making everything sound as if it were a question? Linguists call this high-rising terminal; you may know it as “uptalk” or “upspeak.” What about ending sentences with words spoken in a low, almost croaky tone? That’s referred to as vocal fry. And if modern linguistic research is any indication, you probably associate both vocal fry and uptalking with women, particularly young women.

Candace West and Don Zimmerman developed the idea that we **do gender**, we preform actions that produce gender; we do gender interactions with others and we take into consideration what is believed to be appropriate for our gender


Judith Butler says that Gender is *produced*
- The way we act sustains and reinforces the ideas we have created about gender
	- Stray too far outside the lines and you risk being ostracized or ridiculed

**gender binary** - classification system that allows for only two separate gender categories

**androgynous** - incorporating both feminine and masculine characteristics

55% of Americans believe there are only two genders, with men more likely than women to express a belief that only two genders exist.
#### Intersectional perspectives of gender 

**intersectionality** - the ways in which different types of social relations are linked together in complex ways, creating very different experiences for different groups of people
- Developed by legal scholar *Kimberlé Crenshaw*, intersectionality argues that gender, race, class, (dis)ability, sexuality, geography, and other characteristics intersect and interact to shape individual experience

**ethnocultural** - cultural influences of the ethnic groups to which we belong


#### Review Sheet
##### Key Topics
- The sociological perspective focuses on how the social world impacts our gender development. Gender is learned from family, peers, teachers, media, and other sources in our environment. 
- Meanings of gender are created through social interaction. We socially construct ideas about appropriate gender behaviors. We’re held accountable for our gender conduct and are at risk of judgment if we challenge gender norms. 
- Gender is socially and culturally influenced and is subject to change. 
- Gender can’t be understood in isolation from our other identities and social relations. We must consider how gender intersects and interacts with race, class, (dis)ability, sexuality, geography, etc. to shape our experiences and treatment in society.
##### Key Terms
- **Transgender** – People whose gender identity and expression are different from what they were assigned at birth. 
- **Non-binary** – People whose gender identity and expression are not exclusively masculine or feminine. 
- **Cisgender** – Someone whose gender is in line with the sex they were assigned at birth.
- **Gender** – Socially constructed characteristics of women and men, such as norms, roles, and relationships of and between groups of women and men. 
- **Socialization** – Ongoing social process whereby we learn social norms. 
- **Gender norms** – Social definitions of behavior that society assigns to particular sex categories. • Social construction of gender – Process whereby meanings of gender are created through social interaction and social norms. 
- **Doing gender** – Our activity that produces gender, in interaction with others and with consideration of what is thought to be appropriate for our gender category.
- **Gender binary** – System that allows only two gender categories. 
- **Androgynous** – Incorporating both feminine and masculine characteristics. 
- **Intersectionality** – Social theory that examines how social relations are inextricably linked. 
- **Ethnocultural** – Cultural influences of the ethnic groups to which we belong that affect our behavior.

### Inequalities and Progress

#### Feminism
**gender inequality** -  individuals or groups are treated and perceived differently based upon their gender 
**feminism** - refers to a collection of movements that advocate for equality for all sexes and genders
- broad coalition of women who fought for the right to vote, receive an education, have custody of their children, own property, get married and divorced when they wished, and have the same career choices as men
#### Institutional inequality
Results from a survey of 210 women in the technology industry (specifically Silicon Valley). Indicate that the experiences of the women in the article aren’t uncommon:
- 47% reported being asked to do lower-level tasks that male colleagues were not asked to do, such as taking notes and ordering food
- 87% experienced demeaning comments from male colleagues
- 66% felt excluded from networking opportunities because of their gender
- 60% reported unwanted sexual advances (many coming from a superior)

The wage gap has narrowed significantly in recent decades, but some groups of women have made much more progress than others
- White women earned 60 cents for every dollar earned by White men in 1980, now its 82 cents
- Black women earned 56 cents for every dollar earned by White men in 1980; this has only increased to 65 cents

**motherhood penalty** - the systematic disadvantages in wages, benefits, and other career factors that are associated with motherhood.
- Studies of mothers who work show that the costs of raising a child are disproportionately felt by women
	- 7% wage penalty per child

**fatherhood bonus** - fathers get treated better then  

**glass ceiling** -  a metaphor to describe barriers that women face in the workplace that prevent them from reaching higher positions

> Gender inequality, though, isn’t the result of physiology, anatomy, or hormones. It is produced, maintained, and embedded in our institutions. If nature caused gender inequality, then that inequality would be the same at all times and in all places. But it isn’t. We don’t all experience gender the same way. This is cause for hope. If we build inequality, we can dismantle it, too.

#### Gender and violence
CDC reported approx. 1 in 5 women in the US experiences rape or attempted attempted rape in her lifetime.
- Among women who report experiencing a rape, 40% were first victimized before age 18, with more than 28% indicating they were first raped between the ages of 11 and 17. 
- Other forms of sexual violence also occur at high rates - 12.5% of women have experienced sexual coercion (verbal, non-physical pressure that results in unwanted penetration) 
- 27.3% have experienced unwanted sexual contact (such as fondling), and 32.1% have experienced unwanted sexual experiences that didn’t involve physical contact (for example, verbal harassment)

**androcentric** - focus mainly on the experiences of men
- traditional understandings of crime and violence are *androcentric*

*Meda Chesney-Lind’s* work focuses on the experiences of young women
- showed some delinquent behavior common to young girls is survival behavior with SA trauma
	- “running away from home, difficulties in school, truancy… early marriage,” and promiscuity


#### Review Sheet
##### Key Points
- Feminism is concerned with achieving equality between men and women. There are different kinds of feminisms, and people of all genders identify as feminists. Intersectional feminists take into account that gender can’t be separated from other social relations. 
- Gender inequality is produced, maintained, and embedded in our institutions. Sexism in the workplace is one example. 
- Women make less money than men. For full-time and part-time workers in the U.S., women earned 83% as much as men in 2015.
- White men have higher wages than women of any race. 
- Many jobs in the U.S. economy are low-paying and more likely to be held by women. Women of color are heavily represented in the low-wage job sector. 
- The sorting of men and women into different occupations is partly shaped by discrimination and social norms. 
- Studies of mothers who work show that the costs of raising a child are disproportionately felt by women. In no state do mothers, on average, make as much as fathers. 
- There are differences in life expectancy based on gender and race. In general, women live longer than men, and Whites live longer than Blacks or Latinos. 
- Violence and assault are disproportionately experienced by transgender people. 
- 1 in 5 women in the U.S. has been the victim of rape or attempted rape. • Girls are more likely than boys to suffer child sexual abuse.

##### Key Terms
- **Gender inequality** – Unequal treatment and perceptions of individuals or groups based on gender. 
- **Feminism** – Movements that advocate for equality for all sexes and genders. • Glass ceiling – Metaphor for barriers women face in the workplace that prevent them from reaching higher positions. 
- **Androcentrism** – Centering the lives and experiences of men in our worldview and practices.
- **Motherhood penalty** – Systematic disadvantages in wages, benefits, and other career factors that are associated with motherhood. 
- **Fatherhood bonus** – Benefits in wages and perceived competence that fathers experience in the workplace.
 

### Sexuality 
#### The creation of sexuality 
sexuality is influenced by both biology and environment
Like gender, sociologists think of sexuality as a social construction

 Shift away from believing sex was primarily for reproduction and toward viewing sex as pleasurable mirrored the economic shift from a production- based economy to a consumer-based economy



#### Intersectional sexualities

**hyper sexuality** - extreme in sexual appearance or desire 
**colonialism** - which one country politically and economically controls the people and resources of another geographic area.

**Jezebel caricature** -  portrayed Black women as highly sexual and “lusty.”
**Brute caricature** - portrayed Black men as savage sexual predators
- These sexualized caricatures were used to justify slavery and later the Jim Crow system of discrimination, which legally enforced segregation between Blacks and Whites in the southern U.S.

 A recent study shows that the predominant of Latina's in American media is highly sexualized, or “hot" while Latino men are overwhelmingly portrayed as dominant and “macho.”

#### The social control of sexuality

Puberty, the process of becoming a sexually mature individual, is a biological event. Once we go through it, we’re theoretically capable of sexual reproduction

![[Pasted image 20250326161502.png]]

**social control** - refers to the way we enforce normative behaviors through social interaction, values and worldviews, and laws

**medicalized** a process in which society understands or defines a problem in medical terms
- Alcoholism, pregnancy, attention-deficit disorder, and even baldness were all initially understood as social problems, but *became* understood as medical disorders.

**Phallocentrism** - a worldview that centers around the **phallus** in sexual acts or society more broadly 
- The medicalization of ED draws our attention toward it, so much so that penile-vaginal intercourse is understood as the only sex act worth our attention.

**abstinence-only sex education** - students are taught that abstinence is expected of them

**Comprehensive sex education** - "stresses the importance of waiting to have sex” while offering information about how contraception works, so students can avoid unwanted pregnancies and sexually-transmitted infections (STIs)

Gender and sexuality are not simply unchanging facts of biology, but social relations that we actively construct, experience, and express.

#### Review Sheet
##### Key Points
- In a 2016 Gallup poll, when asked if being gay or lesbian is something a person is born with or due to factors such as upbringing and environment, 46% answered “born with,” 33% answered “environment,” and 12% answered “both.” 
- The word “heterosexual” first appeared in the U.S. in a medical journal article in 1892.
- What we deem to be sexually appropriate behavior varies historically and culturally. Sexual behaviors and expressions change through time and aren’t exactly the same across cultures. 
- Like gender, sexuality is a social construction. 
- Similar to how we can understand gender as activity that we “do” in everyday life, we can think of sexual identity as a routine, daily accomplishment that we intentionally perform. 
- Racialized sexual stereotypes perpetuate social, economic, and cultural inequalities.
- Among women who have ever had a child, the average age of first childbirth is 23 years old in the U.S.; among men who ever have children, it’s almost 26 years old. 
- Our social and cultural institutions exert social control over our sexuality.
- 2017 was the 4th consecutive year of increasing rates of gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis.
##### Key Terms
- **Hypersexual**: Depicted as extreme in sexual appearance or desire. 
- **Jezebel caricature** – Stereotypical image that portrays Black women as extremely sexualized. 
  **Brute caricature** – Stereotypical image that portrays Black men as savage sexual predators, especially of White women. 
- **Puberty** – Process of becoming sexually mature. 
- **Social control** – The way we enforce normative behaviors through social interactions, values and worldviews, and laws. 
- **Medicalized** – When society understands a problem in medical terms. 
- **Phallocentrism** – Worldview that centers the phallus in both sexual acts and society more broadly.
- **Phallus** – Symbolic societal idea of the penis



## Chapter 7 Race and Ethnicity 

### Why are we still talking about race?
- in 2008, Obama was elected and people thought that the conversation about race would end.
	- he faced continuous questioning whether he was born in the US and lying about his religion 

#### Race and Ethnicity
- Article I, Section 2 of the US constitution requires an "enumeration" of the population - **census**
**Race** - a system that humans created to classify and stratify groups of people based mostly on skin tone.
-  has been used to create, maintain, and enhance group distinctions and disparities
**Ethnicity** - common culture, religion, history, or ancestry shared by a group of people

![[Pasted image 20250328105046.png]]

**one-drop rule** -  A custom that a person who had any African ancestry was classified as Black.

The categories we create to classify race are sometimes quite persistent, but they can be interpreted in many different ways and—as the Census example shows—the categories can change.

#### Are race and ethnicity real? 
Sociologists think of race as a:
**social construct** - a concept that humans invented and gave meaning to in order to understand or justify some dimension of the social world
- Differences in skin tone or other physical markers have been used for centuries to explain differences or inequalities between groups and to justify treating groups of people differently.
#### The "science" of race
> Even if the best research reveals no biological or genetic differences exist that cause significant psychological, mental, or physical distinctions among races, 
> many people believe there are innate differences between racial groups. Stereotypes lead people to think of Asians as short and intelligent, Blacks as physically superior but intellectually inferior, and Whites as the standard and epitome of the human ideal.

(lol)
> **While there are differences between racial and ethnic groups** in health, cognitive ability scores, and athletic achievements, most of these differences are driven by socialization, environmental factors, culture, and opportunities. Scientists across many disciplines reject the idea that race is rooted in biology. 

**Eugenics** - the idea that we can actively improve the genetic profile of humans, led to forced sterilization of groups labeled as unfit to reproduce

#### Review Sheet
##### Key Points 
- The concept of race implies a hierarchy among groups of people and has been used to create, maintain, and enhance group distinctions and disparities. 
- Ethnicity can be central to an individual’s life, or may only matter in certain situations; it can also fade away over time, as individuals assimilate into the wider culture.
- Sociologists typically think of race as a social construct. 
- Research reveals no biological or genetic basis for the concept of race, yet there continues to be widespread belief in the existence of innate differences between racial groups.

##### Key Terms
- **Census** – A count of the entire population. 
- **Race** – System humans created to classify groups of people based mostly on skin tone. 
- **Ethnicity** – Common culture, religion, history, or ancestry shared by a group of people. 
- **One-drop rule** – A custom that a person who had any African ancestry was classified as Black. 
- **Social construct** – A concept humans invent and given meaning to in order to understand or justify the social world. 
- **Eugenics** – Idea that we can actively improve the genetic profile of humans.


### Explicit and Implicit Bias
**phenotype** - the set of our visible features or characteristics, like the color of our skin, hair, and eyes. 
- The phenotype is affected by both genetics and our environment, and most individuals’ phenotypic features change over their lives. 


In studies, both White and Black children prefer to play with White dolls. In 2005, Kiri Davis replicated the study, with similar results
#### Implicit bias  

**bias** -  tendency to view things in a particular way, regardless of the details of the specific situation
**implicit bias** -  is the association our minds make between seemingly unrelated things ; it is subconscious 
**explicit bias** - bias that we are openly and consciously aware of.

#### Stereotypes and Prejudice

**stereotypes** - widely-shared perceptions about the personal characteristics, tendencies, or abilities of members of a particular group, like intelligence, personality, physical features, preferences, aggressiveness, or criminality. 
- he Irish are rowdy drunks. 
- Jews are good with money but cheap. 
- Asians are studious and good at math. 
- African Americans are athletic and aggressive.

**prejudices** - preconceived beliefs, attitudes, and opinions about members of a group

**group threat theory**  -  to think of another group as an economic, political, or cultural threat

**ultimate attribution error** -  tendency to perceive undesirable characteristics or behaviors exhibited by members of another group as an innate or inherent part of their personality or essence

**cognitive dissonance** - a psychological state in which our preexisting ideas do not match what we see with our own eyes
- When we experience cognitive dissonance, our natural tendency is to avoid the mental conflict and find a way to explain the anomaly. 
	- Thus, if someone from a group we view negatively does something we view as positive, we interpret them as exceptions; their existence doesn’t undermine our prejudiced beliefs about their group.

**contact theory** - how interaction with members of other groups affects prejudices
- *Gordon Allport's contact theory* argues that interaction and exposure can be beneficial, but only under specific conditions: 
- the interaction has to occur in a collaborative, voluntary, and non-competitive space
- we must interact multiple times, not just once; our interaction must be personal, informal, and one-on-one
- the interaction should be legal and the setting must allow participants to interact as equals

#### A sociological approach toward stereotypes
 > Think of people as individuals, instead of projecting stereotypes onto them. Recognize that most of us, from every race and ethnicity, have unconscious biases that affect how we perceive others. And finally, be aware of the consequences of stereotypes, a topic we’ll turn to next.


#### Review Sheet
##### Key Points 
- Research from Drs. Kenneth and Mamie Clark concluded that the conditions of segregation damaged Black children’s self-esteem and self-concept, and that racial identity and self-awareness develop as early as age 3. 
- Implicit bias is the mind’s way of quickly making sense of our social interactions. 
- Individual prejudices are often driven by our views about the groups to which people belong and where those groups rank, relative to our own, within the social and economic hierarchy. 
- Positive characteristics exhibited by members of a group we see negatively are more likely to be attributed to external factors like exceptional schooling.
- Be suspicious of the idea that stereotypical behavior or characteristics are “natural” or inherent; think about potential explanations for common behaviors or characteristics. 
##### Key Terms 
- **Phenotype** – The set of our visible features or characteristics, like the color of our skin, hair, and eyes. • Implicit bias – Associations our minds make between seemingly unrelated things. 
- **Stereotypes** – Widely-shared perceptions about the personal characteristics, tendencies, or abilities of individual member of a particular group, like intellectual ability, personality, physical features, preferences, aggressiveness, or criminality. 
- **Prejudices** – Preconceived beliefs, attitudes, or opinions about members of another group.
- **Group threat theory** – Argues that prejudices grow stronger if we begin to think of another group as an economic, political, or cultural threat.
- **Ultimate attribution error** – Psychological phenomenon in which undesirable characteristics exhibited by members of another group are perceived as innate. 
- **Cognitive dissonance** – Psychological state in which preconceived ideas do not align with what we see with our own eyes. 
- **Contact theory** – Helps explain how interaction with members of other groups affects prejudicial beliefs.


### Racism and Discrimination
#### Racism in individual and institutions
#### Affirmative Action

*skipped, due to time constraints*


#### Review Sheet 
##### Key Points
- Racism doesn’t just live in individuals; it lives in institutions like schools, workplaces, our housing market, our criminal justice system, and our political system. 
- Although the Bill of Rights protected the rights and liberties of minority groups in the United States, Black people were not considered to be full citizens according to our founding documents. 
- Government programs designed to provide educational opportunities, jobs, home mortgages, economic security, and a secure retirement were often targeted toward the White population and often excluded non-White.
- A large-scale social movement centered around protest, civil disobedience, and legal battles laid the groundwork for major advances in voting and civil rights. The legal basis for segregated neighborhoods and schools finally began to break down with the passage of major legislation like the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Fair Housing Act of 1968. 
- Affirmative action has been used to encourage or require organizations, universities, and public agencies to consider factors like race in decisions about which contractors to use, job candidates to hire, or students to admit

##### Key Terms
- **Audit study** – Sociological method in which applicants are matched according to all characteristics that would make them more or less attractive and then sent out as pairs to apply for various services or products. 
- **Racism** – A set of beliefs, ideologies, or institutional practices that are based on the idea that a specific racial group is biologically or culturally inferior to another racial group. 
- **Discrimination** – Unjust treatment of groups of people
- **Institutional racism** – Idea that our nation’s core institutions, like the legal, educational, and criminal justice systems, are embedded with racial biases and preferences that recreate and maintain racial inequality. 
- **Affirmative action** – Policies or programs that seek to rectify past discrimination through active measures to ensure equal opportunity now

### The Persistence of Racial Inequality 
#### Trends in racial inequality 
![[Pasted image 20250328112907.png]]

#### Understanding the persistence of racial inequality 
Throughout American history, race has been used to justify a hierarchy based on skin color and ancestry. It has fooled people into thinking that success and failure are driven by psychological, genetic, intellectual, biological, and cultural differences between racial or ethnic groups

...to argue that there is something about the culture of the Black population that impairs their outcomes in life or their ability to get ahead
- Black Americans have higher rates of single parenthood than other racial and ethnic groups, and children raised by single parents are much more likely to grow up in poverty.
- But it’s a mistake to think of culture as a natural, unchanging feature of a group
- William Julius Wilson analyzed historical data on urban labor markets to show how shifts in the  jobs available to African American men from 1950-1980s created widespread economic dislocation leading to fewer "marriageable” men who could support their families with steady employment.
- Over time, rates of joblessness rose and the rate of single-parent families skyrocketed, along with use of welfare benefits. 
- This happened to all racial and ethnic groups, but it was particularly severe for African Americans because they had fewer alternative job options when manufacturing jobs disappeared.

#### Review Sheet
##### Key Points 
- Whites had thirteen times as much wealth as Black Americans in the years after the Great Recession, the largest gap since the late 1980s. 
- Despite improvements in some areas like educational attainment, there is still tremendous racial inequality in the U.S., exemplified by persistent gaps in the life expectancy of African Americans and Whites. 
- Throughout U.S. history, race has been used to justify a hierarchy based on skin color and heritage. 
- The persistence of discrimination is undoubtedly one reason why racial inequality has not gone away over time. 
- Black Americans have been treated differently than any other racial or ethnic group throughout U.S. history, and it’s impossible to understand racial inequality today without considering this history.
- When we study cultural or behavioral differences between groups, we must focus on how culture emerges and how larger forces help explain behaviors that may seem counterproductive, or even destructive, from the outside
##### Key Terms
- **Life expectancy** – Statistical measure indicating how long people can expect to live, on average.



## Chapter 8 Sociology of Families 

### What makes a family?

There isn't a single definition of what a family is, based on the differences per cultures.

**family** - refers to a group of people who are connected by blood, a sexual relationship or the law

You can't control who is born into your family, but you do have some control over who makes up our family

**kinship** - most basic form of human relationship, includes relationships defined by blood, affinity (affection) and adoption. 


How do we create a family?
- **marriage** - a socially sanctioned union that includes legal rights and responsibilities of the spouses to each other, their children, and the larger society.
- **adoption** - process of parent(s) choosing to have a legal parent-child relationship with a child who isn't related to them by blood

**blended families** - a family with a step-parent, step-sibling, or half-sibling, has been on the rise. 


**matrilineal** - society determines kinship btwn generations through the mother's line.
**patrilineal** -  societies determine kinship, names, property, and titles through the male line


some norms are considered **universal** - exist in virtually all societies 
- **incest taboo** - prohibition against sexual activity between relatives.
- **longitudinal data** - gathered at different points in time

**polygamy** - multiple spouses at the same time
- **polygyny** - one man, multiple wives
- **polyandry** - one woman has multiple husbands

#### "Traditional families" and the nostalgia trap

**nuclear family** - working father, stay at home mom, and two children
- usually white and middle class
- a "perfect" family that realistically doesn't exist

#### Evolution of the American family
**companionate affection** - a deep emotional commitment

![[Pasted image 20250401152320.png]]

sociologists debate how to interpret family change.
- David Popenoe argues that the family continues to weaken.
	- culture places more focus on self-fulfillment than families

#### Divorce and the typical American Family

**divorce** - legally recognized termination of a marriage
- **no-fault divorce** -  allowed couples to divorce without having to prove that one of them broke their marriage vows or acted irresponsibly

**gray divorce** - divorce rates of those 50 years or older


#### Review Sheet
##### Key Points
- The configuration of a family varies over time and across cultures. 
- There is no such thing as a “traditional” family – throughout history people have lived in diverse family forms.
- Marrying for love is a modern idea, and by no means a cultural universal. 
- As societies change, so do families; family diversity is on the rise. There is no longer a single, dominant family form.
- 69% of American children now live in families with two parents, making it the most common family arrangement.
- The second-most-common family arrangement is children with a single mother (23%). 
- The divorce rate has been declining for the last 40 years, and hit a low in 2018.

##### Key Terms
- **Family** – A group connected by blood, sexual relationship, or the law. 
- **Marriage** – Socially-sanctioned union that includes rights and responsibilities of the spouses to each other, their children, and the larger society.
- **Adoption** – Process of parents voluntarily choosing to have a legal parent-child relationship with a child that is not related by blood. 
- **Blended family** – Family with a step-parent, step-sibling or half-sibling. 
- **Matrilineal society** – Determines kinship, names, property, and titles through the female line.
- **Patrilineal society** – Determines kinship, names, property, and titles through the male line. 
- **Universal norm** – A norm that exist in virtually every society. 
- **Incest taboo** – Cultural prohibition against sexual relations between people who are related to one another.
- **Longitudinal data** – Data gathered at different points in time. 
- **Polygamy** – Having multiple spouses at the same time. **Polygyny** – One man has multiple wives at the same time.
- **Polyandry** – One woman has multiple husbands at the same time. 
- **Nuclear family** – A married couple and their dependent children.
- **May-December relationship** – Relationship in which there is a large age gap between partners. 
- **Companionate affection** – Deep emotional commitment.
- **Divorce** – Legally-recognized termination of a marriage.
- **No-fault divorce** – marriage dissolutions in which neither spouse is required to prove the fault of the other
- **Gray divorce** – Divorce over the age of 50

### Meeting Mating and Multiplying - Or Not

#### Mate selection in the 21st century 
**social integration** - the degree to which people are connected to each other and to social institutions
- provides us with connections to potential mates

many people still meet their partners through friends, yet in the last decade online dating has grown exponentially.

**thin market** - the cost to finding potential partners presents a barrier to forming relationships
- LGBTQ+ ppl have benefited from online dating

> the OkCupid data point to clear racial preferences in responses. When men do the asking, White men are more likely to get responses from women of all races; Black and Asian men are far less likely. When women do the asking, men are dramatically less likely to respond to Black women. 
> The OkCupid data also echoes what we see more broadly in American relationships: all groups say they think interracial relationships are theoretically acceptable, but Whites are the least likely to actually be in an interracial relationship.

**hookup** - sexual encounter characterized by a lack of longstanding commitment
- people are delaying marriage
- increasing number of people spend their early adulthood in college, with fewer rules than they've ever had before.

still **double standard** for sexual behavior in hookups:
- women’s reputations still suffer more for engaging in hook-ups than men’s do. And Bogle’s female respondents frequently said they wanted relationships, because hook-ups usually led to “nothing.”
-  research shows that heterosexual hook-ups are less likely to lead to an orgasm for women than sex in relationships does, in part because both partners are more dismissive of women’s pleasure in hook-ups, but believe strongly in women’s entitlement to sexual pleasure within a relationship.

#### The cohabitation revolution 

**cohabitation** - living together
- most common from of romantic relationship where people live together
- national survey data have documented a **cohabition effect** - marriages that begin with cohabitation are more likely to end in divorce.

**relationship inertia**  - some research says that cohabition encourages people to "slide" into marriage, rather than deciding to marry

#### The wedding industrial complex 

weddings cost in 2017 was almost $26,000, with median around $14,000

**wedding industrial complex** -  merging of industry with social rituals surrounding marriage

as 20th century progressed, weddings became more surrounded by...
**consumer rites** -elaborations of older customs as businesses attempted to create new markets for their services and products. 

**heteronormative** -  reflecting the attitude and assumption that heterosexuality is normal and natural. 

#### Fertility and reproduction

families are now smaller than they were in previous generations
- women are spending more time in school and work may reduce willingness to have children
- improved (long term) contraceptives
- marriage rates is at an all time low

**fertility rates** - births per woman
- declined in many countries around the world

#### Review Sheet
##### Key Points
- Finding a mate through face-to-face means is getting more difficult due to increasing societal complexity. 
- Mate selection in the 21st century is characterized by online dating apps. 
- Mating responses online are subject to the same sets of prejudices and preferences that sociologists have noted for generations. 
- OKCupid reports that among their users, only 43% of men and 17% of women say they enjoy meaningless sex compared to 48% of men and 27% of women in 2008. 
- Increasing numbers of couples are choosing to live together instead of marrying. 
- Over 12 million unmarried partners live together in the United States. 
- Many of the modern rituals we associate with weddings stem from commercial, rather than cultural, interests. The mean cost of a wedding is nearly $26,000. 
- Families are smaller than ever before, and more women are having children later than ever. 
- The teen birth rate has hit historic lows due to more consistent and effective use of birth control.

##### Key Terms
- **Social integration** – Degree to which people in a community have connections to one another’s daily lives. 
- **Double standard for sexual behavior** – Women are judged more harshly than men are for the same sexual behavior. 
- **Cohabitation revolution** – Growth in number of couples living together instead of getting married.
