# Important Background Information 
## Physiology

- senses should be focused on, leads to => **working memory**
- **working memory**: holds and manipulates a *limited* amount of information simultaneously

## Higher Order Thinking
 
 Bloom's Taxonomy
![[Pasted image 20240912141723.png]]

- #### Lower order thinking 
	- Remember and understand  ; usually translates to the students *inability* to solve complex inferential questions that require the synthesis of knowledge

*Example of Bloom's Taxonomy - photosynthesis*
1. **Remember** 	:  The student can regurgitate the equation for photosynthesis.                                                                  (6 CO2 + 6 H20 C6H12O6 + 6 O2)
2. **Understand** 	: The student can explain the roles played by organelles such as chloroplasts and                                    chlorophyll.
3. **Apply**		: The student can apply their knowledge to predict how changes in temperature                                     might affect the rate of photosynthesis.
4. **Analyze**		: The student can compare and contrast photosynthesis to other biological processes,                            like cellular respiration.
5. **Evaluate**		: The student can prioritize the key factors influencing the rate of photosynthesis,                                   ranking them by their relative importance, such as light intensity, temperature, and                               carbon dioxide concentration
6. **Create**		: The student can design an educational presentation to teach their peers about                                     photosynthesis.

Many students engage solely on the lower orders of thinking, and being unable to **apply, analyze, evaluate and create** information. 
- it is also important to mention that knowledge throughout your education will build on itself. 
	- Having a deeper understanding of earlier material will set you up for success in later classes.

## It Starts and Ends With the "Big Picture"

Students focus so much on understanding every minute detail of a concept before moving - without thinking about how the information is relevant to the overall topic 
- They forget concepts they learned earlier, and have to revise them repeatedly 
- They fail to answer inference-based questions on exams which is the dominant form of higher education
it is important to consider how *information is structured* within long term memory
### Chunking and the Sider Web Analogy 

**Chunking** - break down large info into smaller info. small groups of info can be related to one another to form big picture. consider a spider web

 #### Spider Web Analogy
![[Pasted image 20240912143730.png]]
1.  The spider establishes the foundation with borders and radial lines for other threads to connect to
2.  It reinforces the foundation by adding additional threads
3.  It lays down sticky threads that spiral inward from the outer edge towards the center
4.  the result is a perfectly crafted web that enables the spider to not only capture all of the prey that lands within it but also enables the spider to efficiently retrieve its food later.

If you design your learning system to behave like that web where it captures all new info in an organized manner, your brain would be able to retrieve that info efficiently


### Priming Strategy
- allows you to prepare before class - involving higher order thinking while also understanding the big picture
	1. **Establish a framework** - identify **major groups and relationships** to form clearer "big picture" (so that all new knowledge can be connected to it) 
	2. **Visualize Knowledge** - reinforce foundation by visually representing this framework, illustrating the **structure and flow** of knowledge
	3. **Increase Relevance** - take short pretest to further analyze how diff concepts **come together** and use the **hypercorrection effect** to make info in the class "stick"

## Defining Active Recall
*(Book shows 2 experiments that prove it works, pg 13 the book)*

**active recall** -  involves the deliberate and effortful retrieval of information from memory without referring to the source material.
- accurate self-assessment of students' understanding of topic.
- facilitates higher-order thinking as per Bloom's taxonomy
