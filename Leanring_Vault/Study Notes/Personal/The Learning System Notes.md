# Important Background Information 
## Physiology

- senses should be focused on, leads to => **working memory**
- **working memory**: holds and manipulates a *limited* amount of information simultaneously

## Higher Order Thinking
 
 Bloom's Taxonomy
![[Pasted image 20240912141723.png]]

- #### Lower order thinking 
	- Remember and understand  ; usually translates to the students *inability* to solve complex inferential questions that require the synthesis of knowledge

*Example of Bloom's Taxonomy - photosynthesis*
1. **Remember** 	:  The student can regurgitate the equation for photosynthesis.                                                                  (6 CO2 + 6 H20 C6H12O6 + 6 O2)
2. **Understand** 	: The student can explain the roles played by organelles such as chloroplasts and chlorophyll.
3. **Apply**		: The student can apply their knowledge to predict how changes in temperature might affect the rate of photosynthesis.
4. **Analyze**		: The student can compare and contrast photosynthesis to other biological processes, like cellular respiration.
5. **Evaluate**		: The student can prioritize the key factors influencing the rate of photosynthesis, ranking them by their relative importance, such as light intensity, temperature, and carbon dioxide concentration
6. **Create**		: The student can design an educational presentation to teach their peers about photosynthesis.

Many students engage solely on the lower orders of thinking, and being unable to **apply, analyze, evaluate and create** information. 
- it is also important to mention that knowledge throughout your education will build on itself. 
	- Having a deeper understanding of earlier material will set you up for success in later classes.

## It Starts and Ends With the "Big Picture"

Students focus too much on understanding every  detail of a concept before moving on - w/o thinking about how the information is relevant to overall topic 
- They forget concepts they learned earlier, and have to revisit them repeatedly 
- They fail to answer inference-based questions on exams 
	- which is the dominant form of higher education
it is important to consider how *information is structured* within long term memory
### Chunking and the Spider Web Analogy 

**Chunking** - break down large info into smaller info. small groups of info can be related to one another to form big picture. consider a spider web

#### Spider Web Analogy
![[Pasted image 20240912143730.png]]
If you design your learning system to behave like that web where it captures all new info in an organized manner, your brain would be able to retrieve that info efficiently


### Priming Strategy
- allows you to prepare before class - involving higher order thinking while also understanding the big picture
	1. **Establish a framework** - identify **major groups and relationships** to form clearer "big picture" (so that all new knowledge can be connected to it) 
	2. **Visualize Knowledge** - reinforce foundation by visually representing this framework, illustrating the **structure and flow** of knowledge
	3. **Increase Relevance** - take short pretest to further analyze how diff concepts **come together** and use the **hyper-correction effect** to make info in the class "stick"

## Defining Active Recall
*(Book shows 2 experiments that prove its the best method for learning compared to other forms, pg 13)*

**active recall** -  involves the deliberate and effortful retrieval of information from memory without referring to the source material.
- accurate self-assessment of students' understanding of topic.
- facilitates higher-order thinking as per Bloom's taxonomy

## Active Recall Applications
##### Pretests
- proactively identify questions related to the upcoming topics (syllabus, textbook, etc.)
	 - remember, new info in your class is built upon previous material. 
- try to your honest and best with answering the questions - even if you get them wrong
	 - trying to benefit from the hyper-correction effect

##### In-class active recall questions
- in the beginning, ask simple question like "what is...." to clarify fundamental concepts or definitions.
- Once you become more familiar with the process, aim to reduce amount of questions and increase the quality of each question.
	- create questions that facilitate higher-order thinking; 
		- *How does this information relate to what weâ€™ve previously learned?* 
		- *Can you provide an example that illustrates this concept?*
		- *Why is this information important?* 
		- *What are the potential real-world applications?*
		- *Can you explain the steps/process involved in this phenomenon?*
		- *What are the main variables that influence this outcome?* 
		- *How does altering a variable affect the outcome?* 
		- *How could this information be tested on the exam?*
		- etc. 
- ###### You can add on to your answers... later down the line
	- "what is hydrocephalus?"
		- is the accumulation of central cerebrospinal fluid within the ventricles of the brain (simple definition)
			- *this can exert dangerous amounts of pressure on the surrounding brain tissue, potentially leading to death and could require an operation for drainage.* (Additional information from recall)
			- *tip - don't write out all your answers - just answer them verbally*
- the goal is to **struggle** - not to get every question correct, but rather working through retrieval practice to **stimulate your brain for long-term learning**.

##### Blurting method
- a technique that involves reading a section or listening to a lecture and then closing source - trying to write down as much of the info that you can remember 
	- once done, reopen source and compare what you wrote down to the text
- it is an effective method for 2 reasons:
	1. You are actively organizing info inside your brain and reducing the interference between various memories.
	2. Your are stimulating exam conditions
		- in higher ed, you'll be asked inference based questions that require you to gather all related info in order to solve the question


##### Feynman Technique 
- after being able to generally comprehend the info, try explaining the information so that a 5th grader can understand it.
	- breaking down a concept into simple terms can reveal knowledge gaps 
		- if you cannot fill those gaps with present knowledge, target it for further study
	- trying to explain complex topics while simultaneously making them simple encourage higher-order thinking
- in higher education and at jobs, you will be asked to present information to an audience that doesn't know as much as you do on the topic. 
	- Being able to do this technique now will greatly help in those future endeavors. 

##### Practice Tests
- problem sets are arguably the single greatest resource you can use in preparation for an exam. however, they are often quite misused.
	- Student reads a question
	- makes one attempt
	- checks the correct answer 
	- and quickly moves on to the next question 

- The proper way would be the following:
	- Put away all notes
	- read the question 
	- attempt to answer the question *thoroughly in writing* 
		- for multiple choice: take a minute to explain why the other answers are wrong
- if stuck, give yourself few minutes to actively work through the problem creating linkages between related concepts 
	- still stuck, go back to the material from the priming, in class notes, and post class immediate review stages
		- still stuck, take out the textbook or lecture and look for the info to provide the best answer possible
- check the correct answer and explanation 
	- if your answer matches with correct answer - great!
	- if not - also great!
		- you found a gap in your knowledge, which you can go back and fill 

The processes outlined can seem tedious and rather time consuming...
- but you won't need to revisit the material as often  - saving you hours or even days 
*tip: ask the teacher for past papers of the exam. there is nothing better than having that scope of focus on what the exam will be about*

After this, worksheets for you to use in each stage
