> AI has a strong conviction, even when its wrong. Learn how to code properly and use AI to boost your productivity 


nextjs is full stack 
supabase is full stack


cybersecurity is even in more demand 
- and hacking is the biggest weapon being used for war
- it'll never be replaced 

can't do cybersecurity without knowing how to code 
- one of the best ways is social engineering
	- someone used a deepfake to get someone from a company to wire them $60k
		- you don't read a lot about deepfake hacks since they are individually made by the hackers

FOMO 
- force yourself to have it 
- focus up and you could learn anything in 3 months 

- make a project
	- simple html css 
	- implement js
	- then when ready for react
		- listen and read about the docs
	- learn to deploy an express server on digital ocean 

don't jump into next.js until you know react.js

> talks about learning techniques, such as learning and applying fundamentals incrementally as soon as you learn them
> 

consistency is key

use the AI to read the entire docs and give you tips when you get stuck 

Later down the line learn AWS
- it powers basically every large company

## key takeaway 
- learn and apply incrementally 
	- while applying it to a project 

- learn js
	- learn reactjs (express, NextJS, other backend frameworks)
		- 1. nextjs- full-stack framework that integrates frontend and backend | API Routes Allows developers to write server-side code directly within the Next.js app
			- app router
			- page route
