## Section 2.1 - Frequency Distribution for Organizing and Summarizing Data  

**frequency distribution** (frequency table) 
- helps understand the **distribution** of a data set
	- data partitioned among several classes (categories)

Lower Class limits
- **smallest** number that can belong to each of the different classes 
Upper Class limits 
- **largest** number that can belong to each of the different classes 
Class boundaries 
- numbers used to separate the classes but wo/ gaps created by class limits
- 10-19
- 20-29
- 30-39

Class midpoints 
- values in the middle of the classes
	- (lower limit + upper limit) / 2 

Class width 
- the difference btwn 2 consecutive lower class limits in a frequency distribution
- ![[Pasted image 20241016132605.png]]

	- class width in frequency distribution 
		- the difference between 2 lower bounds 

class boundaries
- split the difference between the **end** of one class and the **beginning** of the next class
	{(class A upper bound) + (Class B lower bound) }/ 2

### Procedure for Constructing a Frequency Distribution 
1. select the number of classes, btwn 5 and 20
2. calculate the class width
	- ![[Pasted image 20241016132608.png]]
3. choose value for the first lower class limit
4. using lower class limit and class width, create the other lower-class limits
	1. list lower class limit in vertical column and then determine and enter the upper-class limit
5. take each individual data value and put tally mark in appropriate class
	1. add tally marks to get the frequency

Example:
![[Pasted image 20241016132927.png]]

- creating 7 classes
	- calculate class width : 12 / rounded to 15 for more convenient number for commute time measurements
- first lower class limit 0  / since the lowest number is 5 in our chart and 0 is 
 - add class width of 15 to starting value of 0, these are our **upper class limits**

| 0-  | then we add the other half | 0-14   |
| --- | -------------------------- | ------ |
| 15- |                            | 15-29  |
| 30- |                            | 30-44  |
| 45- |                            | 45-59  |
| 60- |                            | 60-74  |
| 75- |                            | 75-89  |
| 90- |                            | 90-104 |

now we add the frequencies: 
- what numbers fall into the classes that we created

| --- | --- |
