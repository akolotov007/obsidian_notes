- ##### on demand computing power
- ##### elasticity
	- scale up or down as needed
- ##### applications also scale
	- scalability for large implementations 
	- access from anywhere
- ##### multitenancy
	- many different clients are using the same cloud infrastructure

## Virtual Networks
- 1. server farm with 100 computers
- all servers are connected with enterprise switches and routers'
	- with redundancy
- migrate 100 physical server to 1 large physical server
	- with 100 virtual severs inside
- what happens to the network?

## Network Function Virtualization (NFV)
- replace physical network devices with virtual versions
	- manage from the hypervisor
- ##### same functionality as physical device
	- routing, switching, load balancing, firewalls, etc.
- ##### quickly and easily deploy network functions
	- click and deploy from hypervisor
- ##### many different deployment options
	- VM, container, fault-tolerance

## Connecting to the Cloud
- ##### Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
	- a pool of resources created in public cloud
- ##### common to create many VPCs
	- many different application clouds
- ##### connect VPC's w/ transit gateway
	- and users to VPC
- ##### VPN usage
	- site to site through the internet 
- ##### Virtual Private Cloud Gateway  / Internet Gateway
	- connects users on the internet
- ##### VPC NAT gateway
	- private cloud subnets connect to external resources
	- external resources cannot access the private cloud
- ##### VPC endpoint
	- direct connection between cloud provider networks

## Security Groups and lists
- ##### A firewall for the cloud 
	- control inbound/outbound traffic flow
- Layer 4 port
	- TCP or UDP
- Layer 3 address
	- Individual Addresses 
	- CIDR block notation
	- IPv4 or IPv6

## Network Security List
- ##### assign a security rule to an entire IP subnet
	- applies to all devices in the subnet
- ##### very broad 
	- can be difficult to manage
	- not all devices in a subnet have the same security posture  
- ##### more granularity may be needed
	- broad rules may not provide the right level of security

## Network Security Group
- ##### Assign a security role to a specific virtual NIC (network interface cards) 
	- applies to specific devices and network connections
- ##### more granular than network security lists
	- different rules for devices in the same IP subnet
- ##### best practice for cloud security measures
