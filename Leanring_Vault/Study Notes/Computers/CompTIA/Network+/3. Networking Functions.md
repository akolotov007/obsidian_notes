- there's a lot happening behind the scenes
	- access to important data 
	- remote access
	- traffic management 
	- protocol support

## content delivery network (CDN)
- it takes time to get dat from one place to another
	- speed up the process
- ##### geographically distributed caching servers
	- duplicate the data
	- users get data form the local server
- ##### your using a CDN right now
	- used on many websites

## Virtual Private Network (VPN)
- ##### secure private data traversing a public network
	- encrypted communication on a insecure medium
- ##### Concentrator / head-end
	- encryption / decryption access device
	- often integrated into firewall
- ##### many development options
	- specialized cryptographic hardware 
	- software based options available
- ##### often used with client software

## Quality of Service (QoS)
- Traffic shaping, packet shaping
- control bandwidth usage or data rates
- set important applications to have higher priorities than other apps
- ##### Manage the QoS
	- routers, switches, firewalls, QoS devices

## time to live TTL
- ##### how long should data be available?
	- not all systems or protocols are self-regulating
	- we sometimes need to tell the system when to stop
- ##### create a timer
	- wait until traversing a number of hops, or until certain amount of time elapses
- ##### many diff uses
	- drop a packet caught in a loop
	- clear a cache

## Routing Loops
- Router A think the next hop is to Router B
	- Router B thinks the next hop is to Router A
- easy to misconfigure
	- especially with static routing
- this can't go on forever 
	- TTL is used to stop the loop

## IP 
- ##### loops could cause a packet to live forever
	- drop the packet after a certain number of hops
- ##### each pass through router is a hop
	- default TTL for Max/Linux is 64 hops
	- default TTL for windows is 128 hops
- for every pass through router, TTL decreases by 1 
## DNS
- ##### DNS lookup
	- resolve IP address from fully qualified domain name
		- www.professormesser.com = 172.67.41.114
- ##### a device caches the lookup for a certain amount of time, 
	- TTL seconds long
