## Securing a wireless network
- contain confidential info
- authenticate users before granting access
- ensure all communication is encrypted
- verify integrity of all communications
	- received data should be identical to the original sent data
	- message integrity check (MIC)

## wireless encryption
- wireless communication can be heard by anyone 
	- encrypt data
- WPA2 or WPA3
- #### WPA2 and CCMP 
	- wifi protected access II 
		- 2004
	- ##### CCMP block cipher mode
		- aka: counter mode with Cipher block chaining message authentication code protocol
	- CCMP Security serivces
		- data confidentiality with AES encryption 
		- message integrity check (MIC) with CBC-MAC
- #### WPA3
	- wifi protected access 3
		- 2018
	- ##### GCMP block cipher mode
		- galois / counter mode protocol
			- stronger than WPA2
	- ##### GCMP security services
		- data confidentiality with AES
		- message integrity check (MIC) with galois message authentication code (GMAC)

## WPA2 PSK problem
- WPA2 has PSK brute force problem
	- listen to 4 way handshake
		- some methods an derive the PSK hash wo/ handshake
	- capture the hash
- with hash, attackers can brute force the PSK (pre-shared key)
- ###### has become easier over time
	- weaker PSK is easier to brute force
	- GPU processing speeds
	- cloud-based password cracking

## SAE
- WPA3 changes the PSK authentication process
	- includes mutual authentication 
	- creates a shared session key **without** sending the key across the network
	- no more 4 way handshake, no hash capture
- ###### Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE)
	- a Diffie-Hellman derived key exchange with an authentication component
	- everyone uses a diff session key, even with the same PSK
	- and IEEE standard - the dragonfly handshake

## Wireless security modes
- config authentication on wireless router
- ###### open system
	- no auth required
- ###### WPA2/3 Personal/PSK
	- WPA2 or WPA3 with PSK (pre shared key)
	- everyone uses the same 256 bit key
- WPA2/3 Enterprise | WPA2/3-802.1X
	- auth users individually with authentication server
