## non-compliant systems
- a constant challenge
	- always updates and changes
- ##### standard operating env (SOE)
	- a set of tested and approved hardware/software systems
	- often a standard operating system image
- ##### OS and applications updates
	- must have patches to be in compliance
	- OS updates, anti-virus signatures
	- can be checked and verified before access is given

## protecting against non-compliant systems
- OS system control
	- apply policies that will prevent non-compliant software
- monitor the network for application traffic 
	- next gen firewalls with application visibility
- preform periodic scan

## unpatched systems
- Microsoft patch Tuesday
	- second Tuesday of each month (10am PST)
- suddenly, systems are vulnerable to security flaws
	- patch the OS and applications 
- organization might have 1000's of systems
	- some are major services
- one forgotten system may be the weakest links
	- happens quite a bit
- patch management is critical practice
	- test, prioritize, deploy


## unprotected systems
- security issues are often roadblocks
	- applications may not work properly wo/ additional config 
- some troubleshooting tasks can be done
	- disable antivirus / firewall and try again
- permanently disabling security isn't the answer
	- become an expert in application troubleshooting

## product support lifetime
- ##### end of life (EOL) OS
	- manufacturer stops selling OS
	- may continue supporting OS
	- imp for patches and updates
- ##### end of service life (EOSL)
	- manufacturer stops selling OS
	- support no longer available 
		- no ongoing patches or updates

## BYOD
- bring your own device
- ##### employee owns the device
	- need to meet company's requirements
- ##### difficult to secure
	- both a home device and a work device
	- how is data protected?
	- what happens to data when device is sold or traded in?
	- infected device could disclose company info
