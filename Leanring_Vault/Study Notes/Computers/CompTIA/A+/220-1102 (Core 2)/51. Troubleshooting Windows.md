## Blue screen and frequent shutdowns
- startup and shutdown BSOD
	- bad hardware, bad drivers, bad application 
- ##### use last known good system restore
	- try safe mode
- ##### reseat or remove hardware
	- if possible
- ##### run hardware diagnostics
	- provided by manufacturer
	- BIOS may have hardware diagnostics

## Sluggish performance
- ##### Task Manager
	- check for CPU utilization 
- ##### windows updates
	- latest patches
- ##### disk space
	- check for available space and defrag
- ##### laptops may be using power-saving mode
	- throttles the CPU

## Boot errors
- ##### can't find OS
	- "OS not found" "missing OS"
- ##### Boot loader replaced or changed
	- multiple OS installed
- ##### check boot drives
	- remove any media
- ##### startup repair
- ##### modify the windows boot config database (BCD)
	- formerly boot.ini
		- recovery console: bootrec / rebuildbcd

## Startup repair
- ##### missing NTLDR
	- main windows boot loader is missing 
		- *run startup repair or replace manually and reboot*
		- *disconnect removable media*
- ##### Missing OS
	- boot config data may be incorrect
		- r*un startup repair or manually configure BCD store*
- ##### Boots to safe mode
	- windows is not starting normally 
		- *run startup repair*

## Starting the system
- ##### device not starting
	- check device manager and event viewer
	- often a bad driver
		- *remove or replace driver*
- ##### "one or more services failed to start"
	- bad/incorrect driver, bad hardware
		- *try starting manually
		- *check account perms*
		- *confirm service dependencies*
		- *windows service ; check system files*
		- *application service ; re-install application* 

## Applications crashing
- application stops working
	- may provide error message
	- may just disappear
- ##### check event log
	- often includes useful info 
- ##### check the reliability monitor
	- a history of application problems
	- check for resolutions
- ##### reinstall app

## Low memory warnings
- computer low on memory
	- close large-memory processes
- ##### increase virtual memory
	- more room for swapping applications
		- system > about > performance > settings > virtual memory 

## USB controller resource warnings
- USB devices contain buffers called "endpoints"
	- diff USB controller support a different number of endpoints (96, 254, etc.)
- ##### diff devices require a diff number of endpoints
	- exceed the number of endpoints and you run out of resources
	- it's difficult to determine the number of endpoints used by a device
- ##### controller doesn't have enough resources for this device
	- endpoints = resources
	- *move the device to a different USB interface*
		- USB 2.0 interfaces might support a larger number of endpoints
	- *match the USB interface to the device capabilities*
		- USB 2.X
		- USB 3.X

## System Instability 
- general system failures
	- software errors, system hangs, app failures
- ##### time for a full diagnostic
	- could be almost anything
- ##### hardware diagnostic 
	- most systems include manufac diagnostics
	- also run storage and memory checks
- ##### Check OS
	- run SFC (system file checker)
	- preform anti-malware scan

## Slow profile load
- ##### roaming user profile
	- your desktop follows you any computer
	- changes are synched
- ##### network latency to the domain controller
	- slows login script transfers
	- slow to apply policies
	- may require 100's or 1000's of LDAP requests
- ##### client workstation picks a remote domain controller instead of local DC
	- problems with local infrastructure

## Time Drift
- computer's internal clock will drift over time 
	- solution to the symptom
		- fixing the actual problem would require changing the design of every computer
- ##### enable auto time setting
	- settings > time and language > data and time > 
		-
