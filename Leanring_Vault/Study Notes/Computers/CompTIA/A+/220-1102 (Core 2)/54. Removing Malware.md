- ##### also never best practice
	- impossible to know if all of malware has been removed
- ##### ideally, start anew
- ##### reasons to remediate
	- important user docs may need to be recovered
	- get system running well enough to backup certain files

## 1.Verify malware symptoms
- ##### odd error messages
	- application failures
	- security alerts
- ##### system performance issues
	- slow boot, slow applications
- ##### research the malware 
	- know what your dealing with

## 2. Quarantine infected 
- #####  disconnect from network
	- keep it contained
- ##### isolate all removable media
- ##### prevent the spread
	- don't transfer files, don't try backup
	- **that ship has sailed**

## 3. Disable System restore
- ##### restore points make it easy to rewind
	- malware infects restore points
- ##### disable system protection
	- no reason to save an infected config
- ##### delete all restore points
	- remove all infection locations

## 4a. Remediate: update antivirus
- signature and engine updates
	- active anti-virus engine
- ##### auto vs manual updates
	- manual are almost pointless
- ##### malware may prevent the update process
	- copy from the another computer

## 4b. Remediate: scan and remove
- ##### Microsoft and others
	- big anti-virus apps
- ##### malware specifc
	- scan and remove difficult malware
- ##### stand alone removal apps
	- check with anti virus company
- ##### there's really no way to know if it's really gone
	- delete and rebuild
- ##### safe mode
	- load bare minimum OS
- ##### pre-installation environment (WinPE)
	- recovery console, bootable CD/DVD/USB
	- build your own from the Windows assessment and deployment kit (ADK)
- ##### may require the repair of boot records and sectors

## 5. Schedule scans and run updates
- ##### built into the antivirus software
- ##### OS updates

## 6. Enable system Protection 
- put things as they were
- ##### create a restore point
	- start populating again

## 7. Educate the end user
- 1 on 1 
- ##### posters and signs
- ##### message board posting
- ##### login message
- ##### intranet page
