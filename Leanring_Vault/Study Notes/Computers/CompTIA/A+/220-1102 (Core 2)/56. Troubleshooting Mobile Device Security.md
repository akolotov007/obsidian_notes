## Android package source
- ##### once malware is on phone, has huge amount of access
	- don't install APK file from untrusted source
- ##### IOS
	- all apps are curated by Apple
- ##### Android
	- apps can be downloaded from Google Play or trusted app store
	- sideloading is where problems occur

## Dev mode

	- USB debugging
	- memory stats
	- demo mode settings
- ##### IOS and IpadOS
	- enabled using Xcode
	- must use MacOS
- ##### Android 
	- settings > about phone
		- tap build number 7 times

## root access / jailbreaking
- ##### mobile devices are purpose built systems
	- don't have direct access to the OS
- ##### Gaining access
	- Android - Rooting
	- Apple - jailbreaking
- ##### install custom firmware
	- replaces the existing OS
- ##### uncontrolled access
	- circumvent security features
	- sideload apps
	- MDM becomes relatively useless

## Application spoofing
- looks legit, 
	- is bootleg or malicious
- Google removed 150 apps from the store in 2021
- ##### infect the application used to build the apps
	- a malicious version of Xcode  : XcodeGhost malware
- ##### always check the source of a download


## High network traffic
- higher than normal network use
	- may indicate malware
	- command and control
	- proxy use
- ##### check built-in data use reports
	- some of these are quite detailed

## Data-usage limit notification
- built-in android feature
	- not native in IOS

## limited or no internet connectivity 
- malware doesn't want to be removed

## fake security warnings
- easiest way to get on a phone
	- have user install their own malware

	- credit card , stored passwords, browsing history, etc.

## unexpected application behavior
- apps unexpectedly close
	- or excessive delays 
- app doesn't have all normal features
- high battery utilization
