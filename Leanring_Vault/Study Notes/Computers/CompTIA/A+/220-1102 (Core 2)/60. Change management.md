## How to make a change
- upgrade software, patch app, change firewall
- ##### one of the most common risks in enterprise
	- occurs very frequently
- often overlooked or ignored
- ##### have clear policies
	- frequency, duration, installation process, rollback procedures

## rollback plan
 - you should always have a way to revert your changes
	 - prepare for the worst, hope for the best 
- isnt easy at it sounds
- always have a backup

## sandbox testing 
- isolated testing env
- ##### use before making a change in production 
	- try the upgrade, apply the patch
	- test and confirm before deployment
- ##### confirm the rollback plan 
	- move everything back to original 
	- sandbox cant consider every possibility

## responsible staff members
- ##### a team effort
	- many diff parts of an organization
- ##### IT team
	- implements the change
- ##### business customer
	- user of tech or software
- ##### organization sponsor
	- someone's budget is responsible for the process
	- or for the profit

## change management process
- a formal process for managing change
	- avoid downtime, confusion and mistakes
- ##### nothing changes without the process
	- complete the request form 
	- determine the purpose of change
	- identify the scope of change
	- schedule time and date of change
	- determine affected systems and the impact
	- analyze risk associated with change
	- get approval from the change control board
	- get end-user acceptance after the change is complete

## change request forms
- ##### formal process always seems to include a bit of paperwork
	- usually an online system 
- ##### nothing gets missed
	- easy to manage
	- create detailed reports and stats
- ##### usually a transparent process
	- many different groups and people are usually involved

## purpose of the change
- ##### why are we doing this?
	- there needs to be a compelling reason
- ##### application upgrade
	- new features
	- bug fixes
	- performance enchancements
- ##### security fixes
	-  monthly patches and vulnerability fixes
- ##### there needs to be a good reason
	- changes are costly

## scope of change
- determine the effect of the change
	- may be limited to one server
	- or an entire site
- ##### a single change can be far reaching 
	- multiple applications, internet connectivity, remote site access, 
- ##### how long will this take?
	- specific time and date
	- may have no impact
	- could have hours of downtime

## risk analysis
- determine the risk value
	- low,high
- ##### risks can be minor or far-reaching
	- the "fix" doesn't change anything
	- fix breaks something
	- OS failures
	- data corruption
- ##### what's the risk with NOT making a change?
	- security vulnerability
	- application unavailability
	- unexpected downtime to other servers

## change board and approvals
- ##### go or no go
	- lots of discussion
- ##### all important parts of the organization are represented
	- potential changes can affect the entire company
- ##### some changes have priority
	- some happen quickly, some take time
- ##### this is last step
	- actual work comes next

## end-user acceptance
- nothing happens without a sign-off
	- end users of application / network
- ##### one of your jobs is to make them successful
	- they ultimately decide if a change is worth it to them
- ##### ideally, this is a formality
	- of course, they have been involved throughout this entire process
	- there's constant communication before and after
