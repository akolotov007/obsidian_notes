## How windows gets an IP address
- ##### DHCP (dynamic host config protocol)
	- auto IP addressing
	- this is default 
- ##### [[16. Assigning IP addresses#Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA) | APIPA]]
	- communicate locally
- ##### Static Address
	- assign all IP addresses manually

## TCP/IP host addresses
- IP address - unique identifier 
- subnet mask - identifies the subnet 
- gateway - the route of the subnet to the rest of the world
- ##### DNS - domain name services
	- converts domain names to IP
- ##### DHCP
	- automates the IP address config process
- ##### Loopback address
	- 127.0.0.1 - always there
	- used to troubleshooting if IP stack is working properly, ping this

## A backup of DHCP
- multiple DHCP servers should be installed for redundancy
- if DHCP server isn't available, APIPA is used
- can also configure static IP
	- keep working normally
