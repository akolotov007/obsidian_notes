## boot methods
- ##### USB storage
	- USB must be bootable
		- computer supports booting from USB
- ##### optical media
	- CD-ROM, DVD-ROM
- ##### PXE ("pixie") - Preboot eXecution Environment
	- preform a remote network install
	- computer must support booting with PXE
- ##### SSD / HDD
  - store many OS installation files
- ##### Internet-based 
	- Linux distros, macOS recovery install, windows updates
- ##### external / hot swappable drive
	- *install ISO onto USB*
	- some external drive can mount ISO image
	- boot from USB 
- ##### internal hard drive
	- install and boot from hard drive
	- create and boot from new partition

## Types of installations
- ##### in-place upgrade
	- maintain existing applications and data
- ##### recovery partition 
	- hidden partition with installation files
- ##### clean install 
	- wipe the slate clean and re-install
	- migration tool can help
- ##### image deployment
	- deploy a clone on every computer
	- relatively quick
	- can be completely automated 
- ##### repair installations
	- fix problems with Windows
	- doesn't modify user files
- ##### remote network installation 
	- local server or shared drive 
	- install across the internet
- ##### load alternate 3rd party drivers when necessary
	- disk controller drivers,  etc.

## Disk Partition
- separates the physical drive into logical pieces
	- useful to keep data separated 
	- multiple partitions are not always necessary
- ##### useful for maintaining separate OS 
- ##### Formatted partitions are called volumes
	- Microsoft's nomenclature 

## GPT partition style
- ##### GPT (GUID partition Table)
	- globally unique identifier
		- *assigns a unique identifier that no other partition has in the world*
	- latest partition format standard
- ##### Requires a UEFI BIOS
	- can have up to 128 partitions 
	-  max partition size is over 9 billion TBS
	- windows max partition is currently 256 TB
- no need for extended partitions or logical drives

## MBR partition style
- master boot record
	- the old standby, with all of the old limitations
	- max partition size of 2 TB
- ##### Primary
	- bootable partition 
	- max of 4 primary partitions on disk
	- one of the primary partitions can be marked as Active
- ##### Extended
	- one extended partition per hard disk (optional)
	- contains additional logical partitions
	- logical partitions are not bootable 

## Disk partitioning
- first step when preparing disks
	- may already be partitioned
		- may not be compatible with new OS
- ##### MBR or GUID 
	- GUID requires UEFI BIOS or BIOS-compatibility mode 
		-  BIOS-compatibility mode disables UEFI secure boot
- **careful!** 
	- serious potential for data loss

## Quick format vs full format
- ##### quick format
	- creates a new file table
	- looks like data is erased, but it's not
		-  possible to recover old data
	- no additional checks
- quick format is default during windows 10 & 11 install
	- use *diskpart* for full format
- ##### Full format
	- writes zeros to whole disk
		- data is unrecoverable
	- checks the disk for bad sectors (time consuming)
