## Types and Methods
- trojan 
- rootkit
- virus
- spyware
- ransomware
- keylogger
- boot sector virus
- crypto miners

## How you get malware
- Malicious software takes advantage of vulnerability 
- installs malware that includes a remote access backdoor
- bot may be installed later 
- ###### your computer must run the program 
	- email links
	- webpage popup
	- drive by download
	- worm
- computer is vulnerable 
	- keep OS updated
	- applications - check with publisher

## Trojan Horse
- ##### software pretends to be something else
	- so it can conquer your computer
	- doesn't really care much about replicating
- ##### Circumvents your existing security
	- anti-virus may catch it when it runs
		- better Trojans are built to avoid and disable AV
- ##### once inside it has free reign 
	- any it may open gates for other programs

## Rootkit
- originally a UNIX technique
	- the "root" in rootkit
- modifies core system files
	- part of the kernel
- can be invisible to the OS
	- won't be seen in task man
- can be invisible to traditional anti-virus utilities 
	- can't see it, can't stop it
- #### finding and removing rootkits
	- look for the unusual 
		- anti-malware scans
	- use a remover specific to the rootkit
		- usually after the rootkit is discovered 
- Secure boot with UEFI
	- security in the BIOS

## Virus 
- malware that can reproduce itself
	- needs you to execute program
- duplicates through file systems or the network
- may or may not problems
- anti-virus is very common 

## Boot sector virus
- most viruses run after OS is loaded
- some boot loaders an be modified to run malware 
	- runs every time you start your computer 
- modern UEFI BIOS includes Secure Boot
	- prevents unsigned software from running during boot process

## Spyware
- malware that spies on you
	- advertising, identity theft, affiliate fraud
- can be packaged inside trojan
- browser monitoring
- keylogger
	- capture every keystroke

## keyloggers
- keystrokes contain valuable info
	- website login URL, passwords, email messages
- saves all inputs
	- sent
- circumvents encryption 
- data logging :
	- clipboard
	- screen
	- instant messaging
	- search engine queries

## Ransomware
- your data is unavailable until you provide cash
- malware encrypts your data files
- pay up to obtain decryption key
	- untraceable payment system
	- unfortunate use of public-key cryptography 

## Crypto miners
- some cryptocurrency mining requires "proof of work"
	- usually consists of a difficult math problem 
	- answer the problem and earn some currency
- requires extensive CPU processing
	- one CPU isn't enough
	- attacker uses your CPU
- may appear in diff ways
	- visit website and CPU utilization spikes
	- malware installed and mining is always occurring
