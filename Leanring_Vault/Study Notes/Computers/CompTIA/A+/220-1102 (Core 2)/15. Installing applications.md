- extend the functionality of OS
	- specialized applications 
- available everywhere
- not every computer can run every application 

## OS platform
- hardware drivers are specific to OS version 
	- 32 or 64 bit

## Graphic Requirements
- integrated graphics
	- CPU and GPU are the same chip
	- system memory for graphics
	- common in laptops
- ##### dedicated graphics card
	- aka discrete graphics card
	- uses own VRAM
	- high end graphics requirement

## RAM requirements
- random access memory
- critical specification 
	- application may preform poorly or not at all
- this would be above and beyond the OS requirements
	- dependent on the application 
	- consider all of the other running applications

## CPU requirements
- application requirements vary
	- word processing vs video editing 

## external hardware tokens
- manage application usage
	- limit access to auth users
- application will only operate with the hardware token connected
	- commonly USB
	- challenging to manage 
- often used with high-end software

## Storage requirements
- drive space concerns
	- install space
- some apps use a lot of  space after install
	- initial install may not be the most imp. specification 

## distribution methods
- ##### downloadable
	- direct from manufacturer
	- centralized app store
	- avoid 3rd party downloads
- ##### physical media
	- rare

## ISO files
- optical disk img
	- a single ISO file 
	- files an folders
- sector by sector copy of the data on a optical disk
	- iso 9660 file system
		- (international organization for Standardization)
- mount in OS
	  appears as separate drive

## installation considerations
- careful when installing applications
	- applications have the same rights and perms as user
		- unknown app can cause significant issues
- ##### impact on device
	- app upgrade stops working
	- slowdowns
	- deleted files
- ##### impact to network
	- access to internal services
	- rights and perms to file shares
- ##### impact to operation 
	- many jobs are time-sensitive
	- updated application may require a change to workflow
	- or may not work at all 
- ##### impact on business
	- critical processes are sensitive to downtime and outages
	- a change to an application can create significant issues
	- other parts of business rely on your results
