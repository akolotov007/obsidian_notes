## Disposal Procedures
- ##### read your Material Safety Data sheets (MSDS
	- from OSHA (occupational safety and health administration)
- ##### aka safety data sheet (SDS)
	- diff names in each country
- ##### provides information for all hazardous chemicals
	- batteries, CRT, chemical solvents and cans, toner and ink cartridges

## Handling toxic waste
- ##### Batteries
	- uninterruptible power supplies 
	- dispose at your local hazard waste facility
- ##### toner
	- recycle and reuse
	- many printer manufacturers provide a return box
	- some office supply companies will provide a discount for each cartridge
- ##### other devices and assets
	- refer to the MSDS
	- don't throw out without clear directions

## Room control 
- ##### temperature
	- devices need constant cooling
- ##### humidity levels
	- high humidity -promotes condensation
	- low humidity promotes static discharge
	- 50% is a good number
- ##### proper ventilation 
	- computers generate heat
	- don't put everything in a closet

## Battery Backup
- ##### uninterruptible power supply
	- backup power
		- power failures, under-voltage events, surges
- UPS types
	- **standby** 
		- always connected to main power, will move itself internally over to the battery backup
	- **Line-interactive**
		-  always connected to main power, but also has connectivity to the internal battery. 
	- **on-line**
		- always connected to the battery, no switching required
- ##### features
	- auto shutdown, battery capacity, outlets, phone line suppression

## Surge Suppressor
- ##### not all power is "clean"
	- self-inflicted power spikes and noise
	- storms, power grid changes
- ##### spikes are diverted to ground
- ##### noise filters remove line noise
	- Decibel (Db) levels at a specified frequency
		- *higher Db is better*

#### Surge Suppressor spec
- ##### joule rating
	- surge absorption 
		- 200 = good, 400 = better
		- look for over 600 joules of protection
- ##### surge amp ratings
	- higher is better
- ##### UL 1449 voltage let-through ratings
	- ratings at 500, 400, and 330 volts
		- lower is better
