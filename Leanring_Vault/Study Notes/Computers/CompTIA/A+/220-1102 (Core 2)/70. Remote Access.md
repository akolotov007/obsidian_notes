## remote desktop connections
- share desktop from remote location 
- ##### RDP (Microsoft Remote Desktop Protocol)
	- clients for Mac OS, Linux and others as well
- ##### VNC (Virtual Network Computing)
	- remote frame buffer (RFB) protocol
	- clients for many OS
	- many are open source
- ##### commonly used for tech support
	- and for scammers

## Remote Desktop Security
- ##### open port on TCP/3389 is a big tell
	- brute force attack is common
- ##### 3rd part remote desktops
	- often secured with just a username and password
	- there's a LOT of user/pass re-use
- ##### once your in, your in
	- desktop is all yours, 
	- easily jump to other systems
	- obtain personal info
	- make purchases from user's browser

## VPN
- ##### Virtual Private Network
	- encrypted private data traversing a public network
- ##### Concentrator
	- encryption / decryption access device
	- often integrated into a firewall
- ##### many deployment options
	- specialized cryptographic hardware
	- software-based options available

### Client-to-site VPN
- on demand access from remote device
- ##### some software can be configed as always-on

## VPN security
- ##### VPN data on the network is very secure
	- best encryption tech
- ##### authentication is critical 
	- attacker can gain access w/ right credentials
- ##### almost always includes multi-factor authentication (MFA)
	- require more than just a username and password

## SSH (secure shell)
- encrypted console communication - TCP /22
	- looks and acts the same as Telnet - TCP / 23

## SSH security
- network traffic is encrypted
- ##### authentication is a concern
	- SSH supports public/private key pair authentication
- ##### certain accounts should be disabled in SSH
	- for example, removing root
	- consider removing all password-based authentication 
- ##### limit access to SSH by IP
	- configure the local firewall or network filter

## RMM
- ##### Remote Monitoring and Management 
	- manage the system from remote location
- ##### managed service providers (MSP)
	- many diff customers and systems to monitor
	- many diff service levels
- ##### many features
	- patch OS
	- remote login
	- anomaly monitoring 
	- hardware / software inventory
#### RMM security
- ##### popular attack point
	- RMM has a lot of info and control 
- ##### access should be limited
	- don't allow everyone to connect to RMM service
- ##### auditing is important
	- know who's connecting to which devices and what they're doing

## Microsoft Remote Assistance (MSRA)
- ##### get access to remote user's desktop
	- no firewall config or port forwarding
- ##### user makes request
	- sends invitation with details
- ##### technician connects
	- uses the password in the request
- ##### replaced by "quick assist" in 10 and 11
	- latest version
- ##### no ongoing Remote Desktop service required
	- avoid unintended access
- ##### email with invitation details is always a concern
	- consider using voice communication
- ##### perhaps a bit too easy to use
	- social engineering can be an issue

## 3rd party tools
- ##### screen sharing
	- TeamViewer, GoToMyPC
- ##### video conferencing
	- Zoom, WebEx
- ##### file transfer
	- Dropbox, Mega, Box.com, Google Drive
