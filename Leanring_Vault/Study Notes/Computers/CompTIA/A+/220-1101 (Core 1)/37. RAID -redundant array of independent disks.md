## Data Redundancy
- hard drives store huge amounts of data
	- contains imp data
	- have moving parts => eventually break
		- data lose imminent 
			- prepare for that by using an array of drives
- #### RAID is not a backup
	- a way to maintain uptime and availability if one of those drives happen to fail 
## RAID (redundant array of independent disks)
- diff RAID levels
	- some redundant, some not

## RAID 0 - Striping
-  file blocks are split btwn 2 or more physical drives
	- #### high-performance
		- data written quickly 
	- #### no redundancy
		- drive failure breaks the array
		- **RAID 0 is zero redundancy

## RAID 1 - Mirroring
- file blocks are duplicated btwn 2 or more
	- #### high disk utilization
		- space requirement doubles (or more)
	- #### high redundancy
		- drive failure doesn't affect data 

## RAID 5 - Striping with Parity
- file blocks are striped 
	- along with a parity block 
	- requires at least three disks
- #### efficient use of disk space
	- files aren't duplicated, but space is still used for parity
- #### high redundancy
	- data is available after drive failure 
	- parity calculation may affect performance

## RAID 10 (1+0) - a stripe of mirrors
- the speed of striping 
- the redundancy of mirroring 
	- the best of both worlds
- needs at least **4** drives![[Pasted image 20240730201239.png]]
