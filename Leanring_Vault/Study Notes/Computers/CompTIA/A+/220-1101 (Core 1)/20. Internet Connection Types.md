*overlaps with [[10. Network Devices]]*
## Satellite Networking
- non-terrestrial communication
- high cost relative to terrestrial networking
	- 50 Mbit/s down, 3Mbit/s up are common
	- remote sites, difficult-to-network sites
- high latency
	- 250ms up and down
	- starlink advertises 40ms and working on 20ms
- high freq -2GHz
	- line of sight, rain fade

## Fiber
- high speed data communication 
	- freq of light
- higher installation cost than copper
	- equipment is more costly 
	- communicate over long distances 
- large installation in the WAN core
	- supports very high data rates
	- SONET, wavelength division multiplexing
- Fiber is slowly approaching the premises
	- business and home use

## Cable Broadband   [[10. Network Devices# Cable Modem]]
- broadband
	- transmission across multiple frequencies on the same wire
	- diff traffic types (video, voice, data)
- data on the "cable" network
	- DOCSIS (data over cable service interface specification)
		- high-speed networking
			- 50 Mbit/s - 1,000 Mbit/s 
		- Multiple Services 
			- data, voice, video

## DSL      [[10. Network Devices# DSL Modem]]
- ADSL (Asymmetric digital subscriber line)
	*discrepancy in notes for download speeds* 
- Download speed faster than upload 
	- 200 Mbit/s down, 20Mbit/s up
	- ~10,000ft limitation from central office (CO)
		- faster speeds may be possible if closer to CO

## Cellular Networks  [[5. Cellular Standards# Cellular Networks]]
- mobile devices
- #### Separates land into "cells"
	- antenna coverages a cell with certain frequencies
- #### Tethering
	- turn your phone into wireless router
- #### Mobile Hotspot
	- standalone devices 
	- use your phone for other things

## WISP (Wireless Internet Service Provider)
- terrestrial inter access using wireless  
- connect rural or remote locations
	- internet access for everyone
- Many diff deployment tech
	- meshed 802.11
	- 5G home internet
	- proprietary wireless
- Need outdoor antenna
	- speeds range ~10-1,000 Mbit/s
