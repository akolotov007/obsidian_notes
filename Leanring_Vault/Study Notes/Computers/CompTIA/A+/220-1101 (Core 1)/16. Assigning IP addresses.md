- IPv4 address configuration used to be manual
## BOOTP
- October 1993 - bootstrap protocol
- didn't automatically define everything
	- some manual configs still required
	- BOOTP didn't know when IP address might be available again

## DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
- initially released in 1997, updated through the years
- Provides automatic address /IP configuration for almost all devices
#### DHCP Process
- **DORA**
	- 4 step process
	- client sends on UDP 67, DHCP responds on UDP 68
- Discover
	- find DHCP server | **UDP 67**
- Offer 
	- get an IP offer from DHCP server | **UDP 68**
- Request
	- pick one of many offers, request IP from offering DHCP server | **UDP 67**
- Acknowledgement
	- DHCP server confirmation | **UDP 68**

## Turning dynamic to static
- DHCP assigns IP address from the first available from large pool of addresses
	- your IP address will occasionally change
- #### make IP static for:
	- server, printer, or personal preference
- #### Disable DHCP on device / Manual Configuration
	- configure the IP manually
	- requires additional administration
	- no DHCP server reservation
	- difficult to change later
- #### Configure an IP reservation on DHCP server
	- associate MAC address with IP address

## Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA)
	there may be times when device is configed to obtain a DHCP address, but local network doesn't have DHCP server
- A link-local address
	- no forwarding by routers
	- can't communicate outside local network
- IETF reserved 169.254.0.0 - 169.254.255.255
	- first and last 256 address are reserved 
	- functional block of 169.254.1.0 - 169.254.254.255
- Automatically assigned by your device
	- Uses ARP (address resolution protocol) 
		-  confirms address isn't in use 
- Example: ![[Pasted image 20240716180634.png]]
	- *autoconfigured IPv4 and no default gateway*
