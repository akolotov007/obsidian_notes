_using analogy to better understand the idea of IP_
## A series of moving vans
- #### efficiently move large amounts of data
	- use a shipping truck
- #### The network topology is the road
	- ethernet, DSL, cable system
- #### the truck is the Internet Protocol (IP)
	- we've designed roads for this truck
- #### The boxes hold your data
	- boxes of TCP and UDP
- #### Inside the boxes are more things
	- application information

## TCP and UDP
- transported in IP
- two ways to move data from place to place
	-different features for diff applications
- Multiplexing
	- use many diff applications at the same time

## TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
- #### connection-oriented 
	- formal connection setup and closure
- #### "Reliable" Delivery
	- recovery from errors
	- can manage out-of-order messaged or retransmissions
- #### Flow Control
	- receiver can manage how much data is sent

## UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
- #### Connectionless
	- no formal open or close to connection 
- #### "Unreliable" Delivery 
	- no error recovery 
	- no reordering of data or transmission
- #### No flow Control
	- sender determines the amount of data transmitted

## Why use UDP?
- #### real-time communication
	- there's no way to stop and resend the data
	- time doesn't stop for your network
- #### Connectionless protocols
	- DHCP (Dynamic Host Config Protocol) 
	- TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol)
- Data might not get through
	- application keeps track and decides what to do

## Communication using TCP
- connection-oriented protocols - prefer "return receipt"
	- HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)
	- SSH (Secure Shell)
	- the application doesn't worry about out of order frames or missing data
		- TCP handles all communication overheard
			- application has one job

## Speedy Delivery
- #### truck delivers from one IP address to another IP address
	- every house has an address ergo every computer has an IP address
- #### Boxes arrive at house / IP address
	- where do boxes go?
		- each box has room name
	- port number written on the outside of box
		- drop box into right room

## Lots of ports
- #### IPv4 Sockets
	-  server IP address, which protocol, server application port number
	- client IP address, protocol, client port numbers
- #### Non-[[ephemeral]] ports - permanent ports
	- ports 0 - 1023
	- usually on a server or service
- #### Ephemeral ports  - temp ports
	- ports 1024 - 65525
	- determined in real time by client 

## Port Numbers
- TCP and UDP btwn 0-65,535
- most services use non-temporary port numbers
	- some use dynamic port numbers
- port number for communication, not security
- service port numbers need to be "well-known"
- TCP port numbers aren't the same as UDP port numbers
