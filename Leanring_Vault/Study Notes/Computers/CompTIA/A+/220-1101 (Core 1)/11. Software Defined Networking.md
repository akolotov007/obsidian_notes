_all the physical network devices moved into the virtualized cloud based world_
## Software Defined Networking (SDN)
- networking devices have different functional planes of operation
	- data, control, and management planes
- split the functions into separate logical units 
	- extend the functionality and management of a single device 
	- perfectly built for the cloud
### 3 ways to separate devices
- #### Infrastructure layer/ Data Plane
	- _process the network frames and packets
	- forwarding, trunking, encrypting, NAT (network address translation)
- #### Control Layer / Control Plane
	- _manages the actions of the data planes
	- routing tables, session tables, NAT tables
	- dynamic routing protocol updates
- #### Application layer / management plane
	- configure and manage the device 
	- SSH, browser, API (application programming device)

## Extend the physical architecture
