## Random Access Memory (RAM)
- not hard drive or SSD storage 
- data and programs can only be used when moved to RAM
#### RAM Slots
- memory types have changed through the years 
- one of the most important components of your computer
	- speed, speed, speed
- #### Every motherboard is different 
	- check docs
## DIMM (dual inline memory module) 
- the green part 
- electrical contacts are different on each side
- 64 bit data width

## SO-DIMM (small outline DIMM)
- about half the width as DIMM
- used in laptops and mobile devices ![[Pasted image 20240730183616.png]]

## Dynamic random access memory 
- the black squares on the DIMM
	- the memory itself
- #### Dynamic
	- needs constant refreshing
		- wo/ refreshing data in memory disappears
- #### Random Access
	- any location can be accessed directly 

## SDRAM (synchronous)
- synchronous with common system clock
	- queue up one process while waiting for another 
	- classic DRAM didn't wait for clock signal 
## Differences in DDR
![[Pasted image 20240730183950.png]]
## SDR  vs DDR 
- single data rate memory vs double data rate memory // single is older
![[Pasted image 20240730184043.png]]

## DDR3 RAM
- twice the data rate of DDR2 
	- larger chips - max 16 GB per DIMM
- no backwards compatibility
## DDR4 RAM
- speeds increases over DDR3
	- max 64 GB per DIMM
## DDR5 RAM
- faster data transfer btwn memory module and motherboard
	- 64 GB per DIMM
