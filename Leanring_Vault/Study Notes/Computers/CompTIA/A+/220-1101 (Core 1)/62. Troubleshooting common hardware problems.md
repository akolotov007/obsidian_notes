## POST (power on self test)
- test major system components before booting the OS
	- main system (CPU, CMOS, etc.)
	- video 
	- memory
- failures are usually noted with beep/and or codes
	- BIOS versions can differ, check docs
- don't bother memorizing the beep codes
	- diff btwn manufacturer
	- know what to do when you hear them
## POST and boot
- blank screen on boot
	- listen for beeps
	- bad video, CPU or RAM
	- BIOS config issue
- BIOS time and setting
	- maintained with motherboard battery
	- replace the battery
- attempts to boot to incorrect device
	- set boot order in BIOS config 
	- confirm startup device has OS
	- check if any others medias are plugged in (usb)

## Crash Screen 
- aka windows stop error
- aka Blue Screen of Death
- contains important info 
	- also written to event log
- ##### useful when tracking down problems
	- sometimes more useful for manufacturer support

## Bluescreen and spontaneous shutdowns
- #### startup and shutdown BSOD
	- bad hardware, bad drivers, bad application 
- #### use last known good config, system restore, or rollback driver
	- try safe mode
- #### reseat or remove hardware
	- if possible
- #### run hardware diagnostics
	- provided by manufacturer
	- BIOS may have hardware diagnostics

## The spinning ball of death
- MacOS X spinning wait cursor
	- feedback the something is happening
- spin starts, never stops
	- many reasons
		- application bug
		- bad hardware
		- slow paging to dirk
- #### restart computer
	- there may be details in the console logs

## Black screen
- #### is the monitor connected
	- check both power and signal cable
- #### input selection on monitor
	- HDMI, DVI, VGA etc.
- #### image is dim 
	- brightness controls
- #### swap the monitor 
	- try the monitor on another computer
- #### no video after windows loads
	- use VGA mode (F8)

## no power
- at source or power supply
	- get out multimeter
- fans spin - no power to other devices
	- where is your fan connected?
	- no POST - bad motherboard?
	- case fans have lower voltage requirements
		- **check power supply output**

## Sluggish performance 
- #### task manager
	- check for high CPU utilization and I/O
- #### windows update
	- latest patches and drivers
- #### disk space
	- check available space and de-frag
- #### laptops may be using power-saving mode
	- throttles the CPU
- #### anti-virus and anti-malware
	- scanning files  

## Overheating
- heat generation 
	- CPU, video, memory
- cooling system
	- fans and airflow
	- heat sinks
	- **clean and clear
- verify with monitoring software
	- HW- Monitor 

## Smoke and burning smell
- electrical problems
- #### always disconnect power
	- there should never be a burned odor
- #### locate bad components
	- after system has cooled down
	- replace part or whole motherboard

## Intermittent shutdown
- #### no warning, black screen
	- may have some details in your event viewer
- #### heat related issue
	- check cooling system
- #### failing hardware
	- has anything changed?
		- check device manager, run diagnostics
- #### could be anything
	- eliminate what's working

## Application crashes
- application stops working
	- may provide error message
- #### check the event log
- #### check reliability monitor
	- a history of application problems
		- check for resolutions
- #### reinstall the application

## Grinding noise
- rattling 
	- loose components
- scraping
	- hard-drive issue
- clicking
	- fan problems
- pop
	- blown capacitor
	- ![[Pasted image 20240807123917.png]]



## Lockups
- system completely stops 
	- can't do anything
- #### check for any activity 
	- hard drive, status light, ctrl-alt-del
- update drivers and software patches
	- has this been done recently?
- low resources
	- RAM, storage
- hardware diagnostics may be helpful

## continuous reboots
- how far does the boot go before rebooting?
	- BIOS only? OS splash screen?
- #### Bad driver or config
	- F8 "boot from last known working configuration"
- #### safe mode
	- if system starts, disable automatic restarts in system properties
- #### bad hardware
	- try removing or replacing devices

## Inaccurate system date/time
- bad motherboard battery 
	- BIOS config of date/time on every boot
- newer BIOS doesn't get reset with battery change
	- config stays the same
