## Cellular Networks 
- mobile devices
	- "'Cell" phones
- #### Separates land into "cells"
- antenna coverages a cell with certain frequencies
	- #### 2G 
		- GSM - Global System for Mobile communication
		- CDMA - Code Division Multiple Access
		- used for voice communication, poor at sending data

## GSM (Global System for Mobile communication)
- mobile networking standard
- 90% of the market
	- originally and EU standard
	- worldwide coverage
- Used by AT&T and T-Mobile
	- move your SIM (subscriber identity module) from phone to phone
- original GSM standard used multiplexing
	- everyone gets a a little slice of time

## CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access)
- everyone communicates at the same time
- each call uses a diff code
	- used to filter calls on receiving side
- Used by Verizon and Sprint 
	- handsets are controlled by network provider
	- not much adoption elsewhere

## 3G 
- introduced in 1998
-  upgraded connectivity over 2G 
	- megabits per second
- bandwidth improvement allowed new functionality:
	- GPS
	- Mobile Television
	- Video on demand

## 4G and LTE (long term evolution)
- converged standard (GSM and CDMA providers)
- Based on GSM and EDGE (enhanced data rates for GSM evolution)
-  standard supports download rates of 150 M bits/s
- LTE A (advanced)
	- supports download rates of 300 M bits/s

## 5G 
- introduced in 2020
- #### Significant performance improvements 
	- higher frequencies 
	- eventually 10 gigabits /s 
	- slower speeds from 100-900 M bits/s
- #### IoT impact
	- bandwidth becomes less of a constraint 
	- larger data transfers
	- faster monitoring and notif
	- additional cloud processing 

## Updates
- #### PRL updates (preferred roaming list)
	- CDMA networks (Verizon and Sprint)
- #### Allows phone to connect to right tower
	- can be updated over air (OTA)
