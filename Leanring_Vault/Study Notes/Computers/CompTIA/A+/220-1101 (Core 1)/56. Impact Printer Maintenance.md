## Printer ribbon replacement
- replace when ink becomes too light
- designed to be modular 
	- replace in less than a minute

## Print head replacement 
- takes a lot of abuse
	- directly hits the ribbon and paper
- gets hot
- another modular part
	- release lever or bar

usually replace print head and ribbon at the same time

## Replacing Paper
- not as easy as laser printer
	- tractor feed
- forms must be positioned correctly
- paper must feed wo/ constraint 
	- make sure nothing is in the way
