## Scope Properties 
- IP address range
	- and excluded addresses
- subnet mask
- lease durations
- other scope options
	- DNS server
	- default gateway
	- VOIP servers

## DHCP pools
- grouping of IP address
	- each subnet has own scope:
		- 192.168.1.0/24
		- 192.168.2.0/24
		- 192.168.3.0/24
- A scope is generally a single contiguous pool of IP addresses 
	- DHCP exceptions can be made inside of scope

## DHCP address assignment
- dynamic assignment 
	- DHCP server has pool of addresses to give out
		- reclaimed after lease period
- Automatic assignment
	- similar to dynamic allocation 
	- DHCP server keeps list of past assignments to devices
		- you'll get the same IP address (if still available)

## DHCP address allocation / reservation
- Table of MAC addresses
	- each MAC address == matching IP address
- __Other names__:
- Static DHCP assignment
- IP reservation 
- Static DHCP

## DHCP leases
- leasing your address
	- temporary
- allocation 
	- assigned a lease time by the DHCP server
	- administratively configured
- Re-allocation
	- reboot your computer
	- confirms the lease
- workstation can also manually release the IP address
	- moving to another subnet

## DHCP renewal
- *during lease process, other timers exist to check in with DHCP*
- T1 timer
	- check in with lending DHCP server to renew the IP address
		- 50% of the lease time (by default)
- T2 timer
	- if the original DHCP server is down, try rebinding with any DHCP server
		- 87.5% (7/8ths) of the lease time
