## Domain Name System (DNS) 
[[9. Common Network Ports#DNS UDP 53 ]]
* Distributed database
	* many DNS Servers
	* 13 root server clusters (1,000< actual)
	- Generic top-level domains (gTLDs) - .com .org. .net 
	- over 275 country code top-level domains (ccTLDs) - .us .ca .uk 
- #### DNS hierarchy 
- *prof Messer website as ex*

#### DNS records
- resource records (RR)
	- the database records of domain name services
	- over 30 record types
		- ip addresses, certs, host alias names, etc.
	- **Important and critical configuration**
		- make sure to check your settings, backup and test

## DNS configurations
	![[Pasted image 20240716190224.png]]
	- *text based config, also exists as a web-based front end*

## Address Records (A) (AAAA)
- defines the IP address of a host 
	- the most popular query
- (A) - IPv4 addresses
	- modify the A record to change the host name to IP address resolution 
- (AAAA)  - IPv6
	- the same DNS server, different records
- **Text-Based example**:
	- ww.professormesser.com  IN A  162.159.246.164 ; Professor Messer

## Main Exchanger Record (MX)
- determines the host name for the mail server
	- this isn't an IP address ; its a name

## Text Records (TXT)
- human-readable text info
	- useful public info
- can be used for verification purposes 
	- if you have access to the DNS, the you must be the admin of the domain name
- commonly used for email security
	- external email servers validate information from DNS
#### Sender Policy Framework (SPF)
- a list of all servers authorized to send emails from this domain
- prevent mail spoofing
- mail servers preform check to see if incoming mail really did come from an authorized host![[Pasted image 20240716191254.png]]
#### Domain Keys Identified mail (DKIM)
- digitally sign a domain's outgoing mail
	- validated by mail servers, not usually seen by the end user
	-  public key is in the DKIM TXT record
	![[Pasted image 20240716191429.png]]

## DMARC  
- Domain-based message authentication, reporting and conformance 
	- prevent unauthorized email use (spoofing)
	- extension of SPF and DKIM
- you decide what external email servers do with emails that *cannot* be validated by SPF/DKIM
	- policy written into DMARC TXT record
	- accept all, send to spam, reject mail
	- compliance reports can be sent
