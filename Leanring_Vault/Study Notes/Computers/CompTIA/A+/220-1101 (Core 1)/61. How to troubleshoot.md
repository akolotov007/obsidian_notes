## change management 
- ##### change control
	- a formal process for managing change
	- avoid downtime, confusion and mistakes
	- corporate policy and procedures
- ##### nothing changes without the process 
	- plan for a change
	- estimate risk associated with change
	- have recovery plan if change doesn't work
	- document all of this and get approval
	- make change

## Troubleshooting Process

## 1. Identify the problem
- #### info gathering
	- get as many details as possible
	- duplicate the issue, if possible
- #### identify the symptoms 
	- may be more than a single symptom
- #### determine if anything has changed
	- who's in the wiring closet?
- approach multiple problems individually
- #### backup everything
	- have rollback plan
- #### what else has changed?
	- user may not be aware 
	- environmental changes
	- infrastructure changes
- #### there may be some clues
	- check OS log files
	- check (may have) application log files

## 2. Establish a Theory
- #### start with the obvious
	- Occam's razor applies 
		- *the simplest explanation is usually the best one*
- #### Consider everything
	- even the not-so-obvious
- #### make a list of all possible causes
	- start with easy theories
		- and the least difficult to test
- #### research symptoms
	- internal knowledge base
	- google searches

## 3. Test the Theory
- #### confirm the theory 
	- determine next steps to resolve issue
- #### Theory didn't work?
	- re-establish new theory or escalate
		- call and expert
- #### Theory worked

## 4. Create a plan of action 
- #### build a plan
	-  correct the issue with minimum impact
- #### refer to vendor instructions
	- knowledge base, support articles
	- documentation and manuals
- #### identify potential effects
	- every plan can go bad
		- have plan B and plan C

## 5. Implement the solution 
- #### fix the issue
	- implement during the change control window
- #### escalate as necessary 
	- you may need help form 3rd party
- #### 

## 6. Verify full system functionality 
- #### it's not fixed until it's really fixed
	- the test should be part of your plan 
	- have your customers confirm the fix
- #### implement preventative measures
	- avoid the issue in the future

## 7. Document Findings
- it's not over until you build the knowledge base
	- don't lose valuable knowledge!
- #### what action did you take?
	- what was the outcome
- #### consider a formal database
	-  help desk case notes
	- searchable database
