## Storage Failure symptoms
- read/write failure
	- "cannot read from the source disk"
- slow performance
	- constant LED activity 
		- retry, retry, retry 
- Loud clicking noises 
	- the click of death
	- may also include grinding and scraping

## Troubleshooting disk failures
- get a backup
	- first thing - a bad drive is bad
- check for loose or damaged cables
- check for overheating
	- especially if problems occur on startup 
- ##### check power supply
- run hard drive diagnostic  
	- from the drive or computer manufacturer
	- preferable on a known-good computer

## Boot Failure symptoms 
- drive not recognized, boot device not found
	- lights (no lights)
	- beeps
	- error messages
- operating system not found
	- the drive is there, windows is not

## Troubleshooting boot failures 
- check your cables
- check boot sequence in BIOS
	- check for:
		- removable disks
		- disabled storage interfaces
- for new installation, check hardware config
	- data and power cables
	- try diff SATA cable
- try the drive in a diff computer 

## Data loss/corruption
- hard drives are mechanical devices
	- eventually fail
- repairs are difficult and expensive
- SSD may simply stop working
	- sometimes can read but not write
- data becomes unavailable or corrupted
	- can be impossible to recover
- **ALWAYS HAVE A BACKUP

## RAID not found
- missing or faulty RAID controller

## RAID stops working
- each raid is different
	- don't start pulling drives until you check the console

## RAID recovery
- each RAID is different

## S.M.A.R.T
- self monitoring, analysis, and reporting technology 
	- use 3rd party utilities
- avoid hardware failure
	- look for warning signs
- schedule disks checks
	- built-in to most drive arrays
- warning signs
	- replace a drive

## Extended read/write times
- ##### a lot happens when reading or writing data
	- memory access, communication across the bus, spinning drive access  etc.
- ##### delays can occur anywhere along the way
	- need a way to measure storage device access
- #####  input/output operations per second (IOPS)
	- a broad metric of maximum performance 
- useful for comparing storage devices
	- hard drive - 200 IOPS
	- SSD - 1,000,000 IOPS

## Missing drives in OS
- OS boots normally
	- other drives not shown 
	- check BIOS
- **** Internal Drives
	- bad drive or disconnected cable
- ##### External drives
	- no power to the drive or bad cable connection 
- ##### Network Shares
	- shared drives can be connected during startup
	- option to reconnect at sign-in
	- connected with login script
