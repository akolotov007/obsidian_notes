## Case Fans
- cool air is pulled through a personal computer
	- always check for good airflow
- motherboard layout becomes important 
- component location is key
	- devices, wiring, power
- many diff sizes and styles

## On-Board Fans
- designed to cool an entire adapter card
- can be bulky 
- usually seen on high-end graphic cards

## Fans Specifications 
- standard sizes
	- 80,120, 200 mm , etc.
- diff speeds 
	- variable speed
- diff noise levels 
	- not all fans sound the same

## Fanless / passive cooling
- no fans, no noise
	- silent operations
- specialized functions
	- video servers, TV setup box, media server
- Functions are very controlled 
	- carefully measured thermal tests
- low-power components
	- heat sinks

## Heat sink
- dissipate heat through thermal conduction 
	- copper or aluminum alloy
- fins/grid increase surface area
	- heat is then transferred to cooler air 
- gets **hot**
- thermal paste creates good contact btwn chip and heat sink

## Thermal Paste
- place btwn heat sink and component
	- improves thermal connectivity 

## Thermal Pad
- conduct heat without the mess
	- cut to size and install
- easy to use
	- wont leak and damage components
- almost as effective as thermal paste
- not reusable
	- remove and replace

## Liquid Cooling
- coolant is circulated through a computer
	- not a new concept
		- automobiles, mainframe computers
- high-end systems
- gaming, graphics
- overclocking
