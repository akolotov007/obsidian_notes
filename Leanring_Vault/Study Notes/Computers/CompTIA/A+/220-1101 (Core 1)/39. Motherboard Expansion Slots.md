## A Computer Bus
-   communication path
- internal PC growth
- system expansion

## Conventional PCI
- peripheral component interconnect
	- created in 1994
- #### many expansion options 
	- 32 and 64 bit bus width 
	- parallel communication 
- common expansion interface on previous computer generations 
	- PCI express is the newer technology

## PCIe (Express)
- communicates serially 
	- unidirectional serial "lanes"
- 1,2,4,8,16,or full 32 duplex lanes
	- x1, x2, x4... x32
		- "x2 = by 2, x16 = by 16
