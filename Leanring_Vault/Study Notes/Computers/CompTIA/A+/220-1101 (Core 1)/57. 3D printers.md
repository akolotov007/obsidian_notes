- create 3D item based on model 
- additive manufacturing 
	- build in layers to create object
- rapid prototyping 
	- deploy designs anywhere in the world

## Filament Printing
- Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM)
	- melt filament to print 3D object
	- most common type
- print in layers
- good all-around printer
	- larger print bed
	- easy to maintain filament
	- minimum mess
	- fewer disposal issues

## Resin Printing 
- stereolithography (SLA) 3D printing
	- smooth and finely detailed 3D prints
- resin is hardened using a light source
	- ultraviolet light or laser
	- layers are added to the bottom 
	- entire print hangs from build platform
- resin must be handled properly 
	- wear protective gear
	- take unused resin to local hazardous materials deposit
	-

## Print bed
- a flat adhesive surface
- needs to be level and clean
	- prints "sticks" to the bed
