## The secret button(s)
- launching the system startup
	- del, F1, F2, ctrl-2, ctrl-alt-S
- Hyper-V (Windows 8/10/11)
	- turn windows features on and off
- VM workstation player
- VirtualBox doesn't have

## Fast Startup
- windows 8/10/11
	- doesn't actually shut down all the way
	- starts up so quickly, you can't open the BIOS config
- ##### from the windows desktop:
	- SHIFT + restart button 
	- Settings / Update & Security / Recovery / Advanced Startup / Restart Now
	- system config (msconfig)
	- *multiple options, not steps*
- Interrupt normal boot 3 times
	- presents the boot option screen

## Important Tips
- make a backup of your BIOS config
	- write detailed notes 
	- take a picture
	- some BIOS can export settings
- Don't make change unless you're certain of the setting

## Boot Options
- what happens when you power on?
	- the BIOS knows
- Disable hardware 
	- unavailable to OS
- modify the boot order
#### USB permissions
- a security challenge
	- very small storage devices
	- very large capacity 
- USB connections
	- convenient 
	- high speed

## Fans
- computing power creates heat
- many diff cooling fans
	- CPU fans
	- chassis fans
- motherboard often include an integrated fan controller
	- temp sensors 
	- the motherboard increases/decreases fan speeds

## Secure Boot
- malicious software can "own" your system
	- malicious drivers or OS software
- secure boot
	- part of UEFI specification
- digitally sign known-good software
	- software won't run without proper signature
- Support in many different OS
	- windows and Linux support

## UEFI BIOS security boot
- ##### UEFI BIOS protections
	- BIOS includes the manufacturer's public key
	- digital signature is checked during a BIOS update
	- BIOS prevents unauthorized writes to flash
- ##### Secure Boot verifies the bootloader
	- checks the OS bootloader's digital signature
	- bootloader must be signed with trusted certificate
	- or manually approved digital signature

## Boot password management
- BIOS password / user password
	- system won't start
	- need the password to start the OS
- Supervisor Password
	- restrict BIOS changes
	- must use supervisor password to change any BIOS config
- remember your password!
	- otherwise reset BIOS to recover

## Clearing a boot password
- store the BIOS config
	- your settings
-  complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS)
	- type of memory 
	- may be backed up with a battery
- usually flash memory these days
	- easily stored and accessed
- reset with a jumper
	- short (connect) 2 pins on motherboard

## The CMOS Battery
- not needed for today's flash-based storage
	- maintains older BIOS config
	- may only be used to maintain date/time
- bad battery will require a BIOS config or date/time
	- config on every boot
- on older systems, can reset the BIOS configuration by removing the battery 
	- newer computers use jumper

## Trusted Platform Module (TPM)
- ##### a specification for cryptographic functions
	- hardware to help with encryption functions
- ##### cryptographic processor 
	- random number generator, key generators
- ##### persistent memory
	- comes with unique keys burned in during production
- ##### versatile memory
	- storage keys, hardware configuration information 
- ##### password protected 
	- no dictionary attacks

## Hardware Security Module (HSM)
- ##### often used in large environments
	- clusters, redundant power
- ##### high-end cryptographic hardware
	- plug-in card or separate hardware device
- ##### key backup
	- secured storage for servers
	- lightweight HSM for personal use
		- smart card, usb, flash memory
- ##### cryptographic accelerators
	- offload the CPU overheard from other devices
