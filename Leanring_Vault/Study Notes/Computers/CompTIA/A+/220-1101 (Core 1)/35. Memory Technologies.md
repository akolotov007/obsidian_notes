## Virtual Memory
- diff names: Virtual RAM, swap files, etc.
	-  temp store things until we find more room within RAM
- #### swap currently unused application data to storage 
	- free up space for other applications
- ### managed automatically by OS
	- some config available

## Multi-channel memory
- dual, triple or quad - channel
- memory combinations should match 
	- exact matches are best 
- memory module slots are often colored diff ![[Pasted image 20240730184752.png]]

## Memory that checks itself
- used on critical computer systems
	- any server | VM server, database 
- #### Parity Memory
	- adds additional parity bit
		- won't always detect an error
			- can't correct error either
- #### Error correcting code (ECC)
	- motherboard has to support ECC
	- detects and corrects errors on the fly
	- not all system use ECC
	- looks the same as non-ECC memory

## Parity 
- Even parity
	- the parity bit makes an even number
	- *counting the ones, if odd total: +1 parity, else:pass*![[Pasted image 20240730185233.png]]
	- *validating with parity bit*![[Pasted image 20240730185401.png]]
