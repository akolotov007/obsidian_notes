## Cloud computing 
- more than just a serve hosted somewhere
	- extend the management of applications and services
- ##### deploy infrastructure in minutes
	- create and tear down as you need
- ##### international scope
	- deploy anywhere in the world
- ##### use only the required resources
	- cost is based on the amount of use
## Cloud deployment solutions
- ##### Private 
- ##### Public
- ##### Hybrid
	- mix of public and private
- #####  Community
	- several organizations share the same resources

## Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
- aka Hardware as a service (HaaS)
	- outsource your equipment 
- you're still responsible for the management and security
- your data is out there, but more within your control 
	- ex: web server solutions

## Software as service (SaaS)
- ##### on- demand software
	- no local installation  
	- why manage your own email or payroll?
- central management of data and application 
	- your data is out there


## Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- middle ground btwn IaaS and SaaS
- no servers, no software, no maintenance team, no HVAC
	- someone else handles the platform, you handle the development 
- you don't have direct control of data, people or infrastructure 
	- trained security professionals are watching your stuff
		- choose carefully
- ex: salesforce.com

*pulled from next lesson*
- ##### basic application usage
	- applications actually run on a remote server
	- Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (DVI)
	- local device is keyboard, mouse, screen
- ##### Minimal operating system on the client
	- no huge memory or CPU needs
- ##### Network Connectivity
	- big network requirement
		- everything happens across the wire
