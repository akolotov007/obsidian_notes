## The importance of Cable
- fundamental to network communication
- only one good opportunity at building your cabling infrastructure
	- make it good!
- the vast majority of wireless communication uses cables 

## Twisted Pair Copper Cabling
- balanced pair operation
	- two wires with equal and opposite signals
	- Transmit+, Transmit- / Receive+, Receive-
- The twist is the secret
	- keeps a single wire constantly moving away from interference
	- the opposite signals are compared on the other end
- Pairs in the same cable have different twist rates

#### Copper Cable Categories

| Ethernet Standard | Cable Category          | Max supported Distance                     |
| ----------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| 1000BASE-T        | Category 5              | 100 meters                                 |
| 1000BASE-T        | Category 5e (enhanced)  | 100 meters                                 |
| 10GBASE-T         | Category 6              | Unshielded:55 meters, Shielded: 100 meters |
| 10GBASE-T         | Category 6A (augmented) | 100 meters                                 |



## Coaxial Cables
- two or more forms share a common axis
- RG-6 used in television/digital cable
	- and high speed internet over cable

## Plenum 
![[Pasted image 20240723172728.png]] 
![[Pasted image 20240723172758.png]]
- the plenum is a shared airspace between the circulating air-return and the wires run in the ceiling.
- we must make sure that our network cables aren't going to create toxic fumes/smoke meaning that we have to use a special type of network cable so that we don't create problems during a fire.
- #### Plenum-rated cable
	- ##### traditional cable jacket
		- polyvinyl chloride (PVC)
	- ##### Fire Rated cable jacket
		- fluorinated ethylene polymer (FEP) or low-smoke polyvinyl chloride (PVC)
	- Worst case planning
		- important concerns for any structure

## Unshielded and shielded cable
- #### UTP (Unshielded twisted pair)
	- most common twisted pair 
- #### STP (Shielded twisted pair)
	- additional shielding protects against interference
	- shield each pair and/or the overall cable
	- requires the cable to be grounded

- abbreviations written on cable 
	- U = Unshielded
	- S = Brailed shielding
	- F = foil shielding
- (overall cable) / (individual pairs) TP
	- braided shielding around the entire cable and foil around the pairs is S/FTP
	- foil around the cable and no shielding around the pairs is F/UTP

## Direct Burial STP
- overhead cable isn't always a good option
	- cable in the ground
- #### Provides protection from elements
	- designed to be waterproof
	- often filled with gel to repel water
	- conduit may not be needed
- shielded twisted pair
	- provides grounding 
	- adds strength
	- protects against signal interference
