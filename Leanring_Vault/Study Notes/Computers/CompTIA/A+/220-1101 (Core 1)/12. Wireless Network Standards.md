## Wireless Standards (802.11)
- managed by the IEEE LAN/MAN standards committee (IEEE 802)
- #### Many updates over time
	- check with IEEE for the latest
- #### The Wi-Fi trademark
	- wi-fi alliance handles interoperability testing

## 802.11a
- one of the original 802.11 wireless standards
	- October 1999
- Operates in the 5 GHz range
	- or other freq with special licensing 
- 54 Mbit/s
- smaller range than 802.11b
	- higher freq is absorbed by objects in the way 

## 802.11b
- also an original 802.11 standard, separate standard
	- October 1999 
- operates in 2.4GHz range
- 11 Mbits/s
- better range than 802.11a
	- less absorption problems
- more freq confilct
	- baby monitors, cordless phones, microwave ovens
- Not commonly seen today

## 802.11g
- an "upgraded" to 802.11b
	- June 2003
- 2.4 GHz
- 54 Mbit/s
	- similar to 802.11a
- backwards compatible with 802.11b
- same freq problem as 802.11b

## 802.11n 
- the update to all previous WIFI standards
	- October 2009
- operates at 5GHz and/or 2.4 GHz
	- 400 MHz channel widths
- 600 Mbit/s
	- 40MHz mode and 4 antennas
- 802.11 uses MIMO
	- multiple input multiple output
	- multiple transmit and receive antennas

## 802.11ac (Wifi 5)
- Approved in Jan 2014
	- significant improvements over 802.11n
- 5 GHz
	- less crowded, more freq (up to 160 MHz channel bandwidth)
- Increased channel bonding 
	- larger bandwidth
- denser signaling modulation
	- faster data transfers
- 8  (multiple user) MU-MIMO downlink streams
	- twice as many streams as 802.11n
	- nearly 7 gigabits per second

## 802.11ax (Wifi 6)
- Feb 2021
- Operates at 5GHz and/or 2.4GHz
	- 20, 40, 80 and 160 MHz channel widths
- 1201 megabits per second per channel
	- small increase in throughput
	- 8 bi-directional MU-MIMO streams
- Orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA)
	- works similar to cellular communication 
	- improves high-density installations

## Summary of Wifi

## Long Range Fixed Wireless
- wireless access point in a house with stock antennas
	- possible range of 40 to 50 meters
- try connecting two buildings located miles from each other
	- fixed directional antennas and increased signal strength
- #### Outdoors
	- minimal signal absorption our bounce
- #### Directional antennas
	- focused, point to point connection 
- #### Wireless Regulations are complex
	- refer to your country's regulatory agency
- #### Frequency Use
	- unlicensed 2.4 or 5 GHz frequencies
	- additional freq may be available
	- additional licensing may be required
- #### Signal Strength
	- indoor and outdoor power is usually regulated
- #### outdoor antenna installation is not trivial 
	- get an expert, be safe

## RFID (radio freq identification)
- its everywhere
	- access badges
	- inventory/assembly line tracking
	- anything that needs to be tracked
- Radar Tech
	- Radio transmitted to the tag 
	- RF power the tag, ID is transmitted back
	- Bi-directional communication
	- some tag formats can be active/powered

## NFC (near field communication)
- two-way wireless communication
	- builds on RFID, which is mostly one way
- Payment systems
	- online wallets
- bootstrap for other wireless
	- NFC helps with bluetooth pairing 
- Access token, identity "card"
	- short range with encryption support
