## Cable Crimpers
- "Pinch" the connector onto a wire
	- coaxial, twisted pair, fiber
- connect the modular connector to the ethernet cable
	- final step in process of installation
- metal prongs are pushed through the wires insulation
	- plug is permanently pressed onto the cable sheath

#### Crimping best practices
- get a good crimper
	- along with good pair of cable snips (electrician's scissors), and wire stripper
- make sure to use correct modular connectors
	- difference btwn wire types
- Practice 
	- won't take long to become proficient

## Wi-Fi analyzer
- wireless networks are incredibly easy to monitor
	- everyone "hears" everything
- Purpose-built hardware or mobile device add-on
	- specializes in 802.11 analysis
- Identify errors and interference
	- validate antenna location and installation

## Tone Generator
- aka tone probe
	- where does that wire go?
		- follow the tone
- Tone Generator
	- puts an analog sound on the wire
- inductive probe
	- doesn't need to touch the copper
	- hear through small speaker

#### Using the tone generator and probe
- easy wire tracing
- connect the tone generator to the wire
	- modular jack
	- coax
	- punch down connectors
- use the probe to locate the sound

## Punch Down Tool
- "punch" a wire into a wiring block
	- 66 block, 110 block, and others
- Can be tedious
	-  every wire must be individually punched
- trims the wires during the punch
	- efficient process
#### Punch down best practices
- organization is key
	- lots of wires
	- cable management
- Maintain your twists
	- *your category 6A cable will thank you later*
- #### Document everything
	- written documentation
	- tags
	- graffiti

## Cable Testers
- Relatively simple 
	- continuity test (pin 1 is connected to pin 1, etc.)
	- a simple wire map
- Can identify missing pins
	- or crossed wires
- Not usually used for frequency testing
	- crosstalk, signal loss, etc.

## Loopback Plugs
- useful for testing physical ports
	- or fooling your applications 
- Serial / Rs-232 (9 or 25 pin)
- Network connections
	- ethernet, T1, fiber
- **not** cross- over cable

## Taps and port mirrors
- intercept network traffic
	- send a copy to a packet capture device
- Physical Taps
	- disconnect the link, put the tap in the middle
	- can be active or passive tap
- Port Mirror 
	- port redirection, SPAN (Switched Port ANalyzer)
	- software-based tap
	- limited functionality, but can work well in a pinch
