## LCD (Liquid Crystal Display)
- #### Advantages
	- lightweight
	- low power use
	- inexpensive
- #### Disadvantages 
	- hard to get true black
	- requires separate backlight
		- LED, florescent 
		- lights difficult to replace
### LCD Technologies
- #### TN (twisted nematic) - og LCD tech
	- fast response time
	- poor viewing angles - color shifts
- #### IPS (In Plane Switching) 
	- excellent color representation 
	- More expensive to produce than TN
- #### VA (Vertical Alignment)
	- compromise between TN and IPS
	- Good color representation 
	- slower response than TN 

## Fluorescent vs LED
- #### CCFL - Cold Cathode Fluorescent Lamp
	- thicker, higher voltage, in older laptop models
	- _backlight and inverter_
		- LCD displays need a backlight
		- used to convert DC to AC
- #### LED backlight LCD display
	- backlight is LEDs in array format on edges too 
	- thinner, less voltage, in newer laptops
	
## OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode)
- organic compound emits light when receiving electric current
- Thinner and lighter
- no backlight
- tables, phones, smart watches and even TV
	- accurate color representation 
	-  higher cost than LCD

## Wi-Fi antennas 
- #### Multiple antennas 
	- WIFI main and aux and Bluetooth
- antenna wires wrap around laptop screen

## Webcam 
- #### video and audio capture
	- drivers and software needed to properly utilize 

## Digitizer
- #### converts analog input into digital signals
	- stylus, touchscreen
	-
