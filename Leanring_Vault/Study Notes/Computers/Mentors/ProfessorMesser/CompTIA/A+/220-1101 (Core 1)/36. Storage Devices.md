## HDD (hard disk drive)
- #### non-volatile magnetic storage
	- rapidly rotating platters
- #### random access
	- retrieve data from any part of the drive at any time
- #### moving parts
	- spinning platters // *notice plural*
	- moving actuator arm 
	- mechanical components... 
		-  limit access speed
		- can also break

#### Drive Size Comparison
- 3.5 in
- 2.5 in
- M.2

## SSD (solid state drive)
- #### non-volatile memory
	-  no moving parts
	- very fast performance 
- connection interface is imp part of performance

## mSATA (mini)
- shrink the SATA drive into smaller devices
	- same data, diff form factor
	- laptops and mobile devices
- smaller than 2.5" SATA
	- allows diff form factor
- #### used briefly 
	- quickly replaced by M.2

## AHCI vs NVMe
- #### SATA was designed for hard drives
	- AHCI (advanced host controller interface)
		- used to move drive data to RAM
- #### NVMe (non-volatile memory express)
	- designed for SSD speeds
	- lower latency, supports higher throughputs
	- takes advantage of NVMe  with M.2 interface


## M.2 Interface
- smaller form factor
	- no SATA data or power cables
	- can use a PCI express Bus
		- 4 GB/s throughput or faster when using NVMe PCI x4
	- #### diff connector types 
		- needs to be compatible with the slot key/spacer
		- B/M/ B&M key
		- some M.2 drives will support both

## B-Key and M-Key
- M.2 doesn't guarantee NVMe
	- your M.2 interface may be using AHCI
		- check motherboard docs
- motherboard may only support one type of key
	- check motherboard docs

## Flash Drives
- flash memory 
	- EEPROM (electrically erasable programmable read-only memory)
	- non-volatile memory
	- no power required to retain data
- #### Limited number of writes
	- can still read data
-  not designed for archival use
	- easy to lose or damage

## Optical Drives
- small bumps read with laser beam
	- microscopic binary storage
- relatively slow
	- archival media
- many diff formats
	- CD, DVD, Blu Ray
- Internal and external drives
