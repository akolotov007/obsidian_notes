## Port Numbers
- well known port numbers 
	- client and server need to match
- important for firewall rules
	- port-based security 
- Rote memorization - repetition 
	- becomes second nature after a while
- make sure you know:
	- port number
	- protocol and how its used

## FTP (File Transfer Protocol) | TCP 20 21
- TCP/20 (active mode data) 
-  TCP/21 (control)
- authenticates with a username and password
	- some systems use anon login
- full-featured functionality 
	- list, add, delete etc. files

## SSH (Secure Shell) | TCP 22
- encrypted communication link - TCP/22
- looks and acts the same as telnet 

## Telnet | TCP 23
- telecommunication 
- login to devices remotely
	- console access
- in-the-clear communication 
	- anyone can see the data being transferred 

## SMTP | TCP 25
- simple mail transfer protocol
- server to server email transfer
- also used to send mail from device to mail server
	- commonly configured on mobile devices and email
- **other protocols used for clients to receive email**
	- IMAP, POP3

 ## DNS | UDP 53
- domain name system 
- converts names to IP address
	- ex: www.google.com = 142.250.64.164
- Very critical resource
	- multiple DNS servers in production 

## DHCP | UDP 67 68
- dynamic host configuration protocol
- automated configuration of IP addresses, subnet mask and other options 
- requires DHCP server
- #### Dynamic / pooled
	- IP addresses are assigned in real time from pool
		- each system is given a lease and must renew at set intervals
- #### DHCP Reservation 
	- addresses assigned by MAC address in DHCP server
	- manage addresses from one location 

## TFTP - Trivial File Transfer Protocol |  UDP 69
-  

## HTTP and HTTPS | TCP 80 443 
- hypertext transfer protocol (secure)
- communication in the browser and by other applications 
	- supported by nearly all web servers and clients
 
HTTP is non-encrypted |  TCP 80
- HTTPS is encrypted | TCP 443

## POP3 / IMAP | TCP 110 143
- receive emails from email server
	- authen and transfer
- #### POP3 - post office protocol v3
	- TCP/110 
	- basic mail transfer functionality 
- #### IMAP4 - internet message access protocol v4
	- TCP/143
	- includes management of email inbox from multiple clients

## SMB - server message block | TCP 445
- protocol used by Windows
	- file sharing, printer sharing
	- aka CIFS (common internet file system)
- #### using NetBIOS over TCP/IP (network basic input/output system)
	- UDP/137 - NetBIOS name services (nbname) 
	- UDP/139 - NetBIOS session service (nbsession)
- #### On most modern versions of windows, NetBIOS isn't used
	- in this case, devices use direct SMB connection TCP/445 wo/ NetBIOS transport

## SNMP | UDP 161 162
- simple network management protocol
- gather stats from network devices
	- queries: UDP/161
	- Traps (Alerts): UDP/162
- #### v1 - Original
	- structured tables
	- in-the-clear
- #### v2  - improved 
	- data type enhancements
	- bulk transfers
	- still in-the-clear
- #### v3 - Secured Standard
	- message integrity
	- authentication 
	- encryption

## LDAP | TCP 389 
- lightweight directory access protocol
	- used to query directories
- Store and retrieve information in network directory
	- commonly used in [[Microsoft Active Directory]]

## RDP | TCP 3389
- remote desktop protocol on many windows versions
- can connect to entire desktop or just application
- clients for Mac, Linux, Uni etc. exist
