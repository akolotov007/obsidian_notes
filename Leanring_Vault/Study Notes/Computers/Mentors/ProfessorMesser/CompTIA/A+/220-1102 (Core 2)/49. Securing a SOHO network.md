*small office home office*
## Change default passwords
- all access points have default username and passwords 
	- change yours!
- the right credentials provide full control 
	- **admin access**
- easy to find defaults for access point or router
	- routerpasswords.com

## Firmware update
- small office / home office appliances
	- appliance are usually a closed architecture
	- updates are provided by the manufacturer 
- updates address diff requirements
- install latest software

## IP address filtering
- ##### content filtering, IP address ranges
	- or combination
- ##### allow list
	- nothing passes unless approved 
- ##### deny list
	- nothing on a bad list allowed

## Content Filtering 
- control traffic based on data within a categories 
	- URL filtering, website category filtering 
- ##### Corporate control of outbound and inbound data
	- sensitive materials
- ##### control of inappropriate content
	- NSFW
	- parental controls
- ##### protection against evil 
	- anti virus, anti malware

## Physical placement
- ##### often single devices
	- router, switch, access point, firewall
- ##### location may be restricted to a secure room 
	- prevent access to servers and network devices
- ##### from wireless, location becomes more important
	- above ceiling tiles or another high point
	- this may be cause problems for power cycling
- ##### plan before the installation 
	- may require additional setup time

## IP addressing 
- DHCP (auto) IP addressing vs. manual IP addressing 
- IP addressing are easy to see in an undecrypted network
- configing a static IP address is not a security technique 

## DHCP reservation
- address reservation 
	- admin configs
- table of MAC addresses
	- each MAC address matches with an IP

## Static WAN IP
- wide area network / internet link
	- external IP
- ##### many ISP dynamically allocate WAN addresses
	- default for most ISP
- ##### it's easier to manage if the IP address is static
	- the IT team always knows the IP address 
	- a SOHO might need to provide a service
- ##### this may be an additional cost, 
	- contact the ISP for options

## UPnP (Universal plug and play)
- allows network devices to auto configure and find other network devices
	- 0 configuration 
- applications on the internal network can open inbound ports using UPnP 
	- no approval needed
	- used for many peer-to-peer applications
- ##### best practice would be to disable UPnP
	- only enable if the application requires it
	- any maybe not even then
	- *use a screen subnet* 

## Screened Subnet
- ![[Pasted image 20240822195328.png]]

## SSID management
- ##### Service Set Identifier
	- name of the wireless network
	- LINKSYS, DEFAULT, NETGEAR
- ##### change the SSID to something not-so obvious
	- unable to lookup what kind device it is 
- ##### disable SSID broadcasting
	- SSID is easily determined through a wireless network analysis
	- Security through obscurity

## Wireless channels and encryption 
![[29. Wireless Encryption#Wireless security modes]]
- use an open frequency
	- some access points will automatically find good frequencies

## disable guest networks
- limit access to outsideres
	- guest networks are often enabled by default
- some guest network can be used for other connections
		- IoT
		- lab network
- ENABLE security
	- WPA 2/3

## Disabling ports
- ##### enable physical ports
	- conference rooms
	- break rooms
- ##### Admin disable unused ports
	- more to maintain, but more secure
- ##### network access control (NAC)\
	- 802.1X controls
	- you can't communicate unless your authenticated

## Port Forwarding
- 24/7 access to a service hosted internally 
	- web server, gaming server, security system, etc.
- ##### external IP/ port number maps to an internal IP/port
	- does not have to be the same port number
	- aka Destination NAT
- ##### Destination NAT or Static NAT
	- destination address is translated from a public IP to private IP 
	- does not expire or timeout
