## ipconfig
- most of your troubleshooting starts with your Ip
	- determine TCP/IP and network adapter info
	- view additional config details
		- DNS servers, DHCP servers, etc.

## ping
- test reachability
	- determine round-trip time
	- uses internet control message protocol (ICMP)
- one of your primary troubleshooting tools
	- can you ping the host?

## netstat
- network statistics
	- many diff OS's
- *netstat -a
	- show all active connections 
- *netstat -b
	- show binaries (Windows)
		- requires elevation 
- *netstat -n*
	- see ip address, dont resolve names]

## nslookup
- name server lookup
	- lookup info from DNS servers
	- canonical names, IP addresses, cache timers, etc
- lookup names and IP addresses

## net  
- windows network commands
- ##### net view
	- *net view \\{servername}
	- *net view /workgroup:{workgroup name}
- ##### map a network share to a drive letter
	- *net use drive: \\servername\\sharename
- view user account information and reset passwords
	- *net user {username}
	- *net user {username} * /domain
- ex:
	- *net use {drive_letter_local} \\\\sgc-ad\\classified

## tracert
- ##### determine the route a packet takes to a destination 
	- map the entire path
- ##### takes advantage of ICP Time to Live Exceeded error message
	- the time in TTL refers to hops, not seconds or minutes
		- TTL =1 is the first router, TTL=2 is the second router, etc.
- not all devices will reply with the ICMP Time Exceeded messages
	- some firewalls filter ICMP
	- ICMP is low-priority for many devices

### the mechanics of traceroute

[video explination](https://youtu.be/Zo5s_wxSN10?si=f6oiO723PCQoauAH&t=638)
	- TTL starts = 1, decreases every jump from host to another device
		- if = 0; return to host with stopping point and time
	- repeat process, increasing the TTL+1 every time

## pathping
- combine the ping and traceroute 
	- included with windows NT and later
- ##### first phase 
	- runs a traceroute
	- builds a map 
- ##### second phase
	- measure round trip time and packet loss at each hop
-
