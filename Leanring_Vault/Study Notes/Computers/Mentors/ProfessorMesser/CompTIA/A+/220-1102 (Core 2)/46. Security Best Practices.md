## Data encryption 
- ##### full disk
	- encrypt data-at-rest
- ##### file system 
	- individual files and folder
- ##### removeable data
	- protecting USB
- ##### key backups are critical 
	- always need to have a copy
	- may be integrated to Active Directory

## Password complexity and length
- make your password strong
	- resist guessing and brute force
- ##### increase password entropy 
	- no single words, no obv passwords
	- mix upper and lower case
- stronger passwords <= 8 characters

## Password expiration and recovery
- all passwords should expire 
	- change every 30, 60 or 90 days
	- system remembers password history
		- requires unique passwords
- ##### critical systems might change more frequently
	- every 15 days or every week
- ##### recovery process should not be trivial!
	- some organizations have a very formal process

## password best practices
- changing default user/pass
- BIOS/UEFI 
	- supervisor/admin: preventing BIOS changes
	- User password: preventing booting
- ##### requiring passwords
	- always require passwords
	- no blank passwords
	- no auto login

## End user best practices
 - require screensaver password
	 - can be administratively enforced 
- does not require sure intervention 
	- auto locks after non-use or timeout 
- secure critical hardware
	- laptops can easily walk away
	- lock them down

## Securing PII and passwords
- ##### PII (personally identifiable information)
	- name, address, SSN, etc.
- ##### control your input
	- be aware of your surroundings
- ##### use privacy filters
	- on screen filters

	- may be an involved audit
-  assign rights based on group
	- becomes more useful as you grow
- login time restrictions 
	- only login during work hours
	- restrict after-hour activities

## Disabling unnecessary accounts
- all OS's include other accounts
	- guest, root, mail, etc.
- not all are needed
	- disable/remove them
- disable interactive login
	- not all accounts need to login
- change default user/pass

## locking the desktop
- failed password attempts 
	- should lock account and/or reboot after certain threshold 
	- prevents online brute force attacks
- auto locks the system
	- after certain amount of inactivity 
	- or when you walk away 
		- local security policy;
			- interactive login: Machine inactivity limit properties 

## Autorun and AutoPlay
- ##### disable autorun
- autorun.inf in Vista
	- no autorun in 7,8,8.1,10,11
	- disable through registry
- ##### Disable Autoplay
	- settings > bluetooth > autoplay
- get latest security patches
