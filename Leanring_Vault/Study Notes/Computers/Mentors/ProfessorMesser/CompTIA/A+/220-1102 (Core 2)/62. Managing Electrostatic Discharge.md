## what is electrostatic discharge
- ##### static electricity 
	- electricity that doesn't move 
- ##### Static electricity isn't harmful
	- it's the discharge that gets them 
- ##### ESD can be very damaging to computer components
	- silicon is very sensitive to high voltage
- ##### feel static discharge: ~3,500 volts
	- damage to electronic component: 100 volts or less

## Controlling ESD
- ##### Humidity over 60% helps control ESD
	- although keeping an air conditioned room at 60% isn't practical 
- ##### use your hands to "self-ground"
	- touch the exposed metal chassis before touching a component
	- you'll want to unplug the power connection 
		- *always, really*
- ##### do not connect yourself to the ground of an electrical system

## Preventing static discharge
- ##### antistatic strap
	- connect your wrist to a metal part of the computer
- ##### antistatic pad
	- a workspace for the computer
- ##### antistatic mat
	- a mat for standing or sitting
- ##### antistatic bag
	- safely move or ship components

## Component handling and storage
 - ##### try not to touch components directly
	 - card edges only
 - ##### store in  an HVAC regulated environment
	 - btwn 50-80 F / 10-27 C
 - ##### avoid high humidity
	 - silica gel packets can help control humidity
 - ##### store in the original padded box 
	 - bubble wrap can be a good alternative
