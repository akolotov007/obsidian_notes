 - scripting language - meaning you can execute the code on the fly
 - Just in time compilation
	 - an engine under the hood of a browser called "V8" 
	 - converts the JS code into machine code through a process called: *just in time compilation*
 - dynamically typed  = no data type annotations are necessary

let 
const = vars that cannot be re-assigned later

imperative code = the UI is being mutated directly
- many devs use front end frameworks (Vue, Scala, Angular, React) that produce...
	- declarative code = where the UI is a function of its input data 
- these libraries encapsulate JS, HTML and CSS into components
	-  which are then used used to form a component tree 
	- data inside can be reactive = data binding
		- HTML can be directly bound to the JS
			- meaning that any changes will occur automatically 

get all JS files and combine them into a single bundle that can be used by the browser  
- module bundler ie. Veet or Webpack

JS file can get too big to load at once, can dynamically import code only when that code becomes needed
