- problem:
	- the deployment requires us to SSH to the server, and manually start the next JS app as well as pocket base
- solution 
	- systemd
		- auto restart
		- custom logging
		- set env vars


create config file for systemd for pocketbase,
`nano /etc/systemd/system/pocketbase.service`
- ![[Pasted image 20240830130646.png]]
___
- create the log file with `touch var/log/pocketbase.log` `chmod 644 var/log/pocketbase.log`
- 
- in more detail:
	- the root user is going to run all the commands.  `StandardOutput` && `StandardError` both need log files, which we have just name 

create config file for systemd for NEXT.JS
- `nano etc/systemd/system/nextjs.service`
- ![[Pasted image 20240830131114.png]]

before we can use the file, we have to enable them 
	`sudo systemctl daemon-reload`
	- then
	- `systemctl start pocketbase`
	- `systemctl enable pocketbase`
- the same for next.js
	-  `systemctl start nextjs`
	- `systemctl enable nextjs`

check if working
- `sytemctl status pocketbase`
-
