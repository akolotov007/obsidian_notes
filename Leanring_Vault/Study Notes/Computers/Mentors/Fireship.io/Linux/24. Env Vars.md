- store API key
	- a. `export API_KEY="foo" `
		- only set for the given terminal session
	- b. move to the `/.bashrc` file
		- `nano /.bashrc`
			- paste the API key
	- c. another location to consider is `/etc/environment`
		- contains system wide env vars, that are available to all users
		- good to know but...
- scope the env vars to specific applications
	- *create a hidden .env file in the application dir*
		- `nano .env`
			- frameworks like NEXT.JS know to auto look for .env
