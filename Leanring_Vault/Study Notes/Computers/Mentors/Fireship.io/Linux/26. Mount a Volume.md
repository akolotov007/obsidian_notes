the app we are running collects user data, and the user data is being stored directly on the VPS

## block storage
- like a separate disk that you can attach and detach to the VPS
- *shows how to buy and set it up*

`lsblk`
- see all disk and mounts
	- name of disk shows, in this case its `vdb`
- `mkfs.ext4 /dev/vdb`
	- make a filesystem in drive
		- will erase all data from the drive
- `mkdir -p /mnt/blockstorage/pb_data`
	- make a directory
- `mount /dev/vdb /mnt/blockstorage`
	- mount {this} {to_this}
	- anything saved to that directory will be auto saved to that drive
- `echo "/dev/vdb /mnt/blockstorage ext4 defaults,nofail 0 0" | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
	- ensure that the drive is always mounted when the system reboots 

##### update the pocketbase.service to use a diff directory

	- make sure that after any changes to a systemd config, use system controller to reload the deamon
		- `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`
		- `sudo systemctl restart pocketbase`
