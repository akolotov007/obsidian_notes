anything that is not a primitive:
- string, number, bigint, boolean, undefined, symbol null 
 is an object

Syntax for object:

```javascript
const animal = {
	dna:123,
	legs: {
		front:2, back:2
	},
	sleep (){
	console.log("ZZZ")
	},
};
```

## Prototype chain
-  one object can inherit properties and behaviors from another object through a **prototype chain**
- every obj can have exactly1 prototype, or when you reach the end of the chain it is **null**

```javascript
const animal  ={
	dna: 123,
};

const dog = {
	bark() { console.log("woof");
	}
};

Object.setProtoypeOf(dog, animal)
// dog inherits properties of animal obj
// extends the prototype chain by making the animal a [parent] of the dog 
```




## De-structuring 

object have properties
- diff ways to access them 

in this case, we have a dog obj which has properties. 
- we want to set each property to individual vars to use them throughout the app

```javascript
const = dog {
	name: "fido"
	age: 4,
	bark (){
		console.log("woof!")
	}
};
```

one way is by **dot notation** 
```javascript
const name = dog.name;
const age = dog.age; 
// is ok, but better syntax
const {name: fullName, age} = dog;
		// can change the name to something else
```

can do de-structuring on arrays:

```javascript
const arr = ['foo', 'bar', 'faz']

const [a,b,c] = arr; 
// position here matters; first var name (a) will match first element ('foo')
// can also pick out individual elements to destructure
const c = arr[2];

```


## Spread operator
- creating objects is easy when using the literal syntax, but what if you want to combine 2 or more objs/arrays?

```javascript
const obj1 = {
	first: 'a',
	second: 'b',
	third: 'c',
}
const obj2 = {
	third: 'd',
	fourth: 'e',
}
// share 1 common property btwn 2 obj
```

one way is through the obj assign method 

``` javascript
const full = Object.assign({},obj1,obj2);
// last obj takes highest priority
```

the other is the **spread operator**
```js
const full = {...obj1,...obj2}
```

can also do spread operator inside another obj:
```js
const obj1 = {
	first: 'a',
	second: 'b',
	third: 'c',
}
const obj2 = {
	//...obj1; if here, any properties after that are the same are overwritten by obj2
	third: 'd',
	fourth: 'e',
	// ...obj1; if here, any properties before that are the same are overwritten by obj1
}
```


## Optional chaining 
- one problem that you often encounter when working in JS is you call a property but that object your calling it on is `undefined`. 
	- big problem bc JS will through error, and might break your entire app

- in older versions of JS, you would manually check to see if that property exists,
	- in newer JS, easier syntax

```js
const obj = undefined;
obj?.hello; 
// returns undefined wo/ throwing an error

// can also check on arrays and functions
const arr = [1,2,3];
arr?.[0];

// && 

function foo(a,b){ }
foo?.(1,2);


```


## Nullish coalescing
 - how to determine if something is 'truthy' or 'falsey'?
	 - ex:

``` js
if (true) // always execute
if (false) // never execute
```

JS is a weak typed language that uses **type coercion** to determine whether a value should behave as *true* or *false* at runtime
```js
if (true)
if ({})
if ([])
if (42)
if ("0")
if (0)
if ("false")
if (new Date())
if (-42)
if (12n)
if (3.14)
if (-3.14)
if (Infinity)
if (-Infinity)
// all of these are considered TRUTHY

if (undefined)
if (null)
// all are FALSEY

if (0) // TRUTHY
if ("") // FALSEY
//

const val x ?? 'default';
// ?? == nullish coalescing
// more limited set of values that are considered FALSEY  
// when used, only NULL and UNDEFINED are considered FALSEY 

```

## Higher Order Functions 
#### prerequisite 
- 2 ways to define functions
	- **function declaration** = will always be **hoisted** (use anywhere in this file) up to the top of the file.
		- meaning you can define a function down at the bottom of the file and use it anywhere.

```js
function sayHi (message){
	return "said..." + message;
}
```

- **function expression** = function cannot be referenced until its encountered
	- meaning that any code that is written above the function cannot use the function 
``` js
const sayHi = function(message) {
	return "Said..." + message; 
}
// setting a function to a var 
```

- which one to use?
	- general rule of thumb:
		- declarations for global scope
		- expressions for local scope

can also make **function expressions** *anonymous* 
- can use them as arguments wo/ giving them a name
```js 
const anon = arr.map(function(val) {
	return val*2
});
```

#### Higher Order Functions
-  A higher order function is a function that takes a function as an argument, or returns a function. 
	- commonly used in functional programming, and are a powerful tool for abstracting away complexity.
```js
function funWrapper(callback) {
	callback('Called by wrapper')
}

funWrapper (sayHi);
// instead of naming the function, can make it anonymous
funWrapper (m => console.log(m));

// a function that returns a new function 
function funCreator() {
	return function (message) {
		return 'Said...' + message;
	}
}
const fn = funCreator();
fn('hello!')

```



## Closures
-  function that can access values outside of their own curly braces 
	- *function that closes over some state or data so that it can be used elsewhere in the application later*
```js
let b = 3;
function impureFun(a){
	return a + b;
}
```
- requires more memory and processing power

- *Heap memory*  = long lived  |  *call stack*  = short lived
	- closures can keep data in heap memory 

- has good reason to be used, such as:
- **Data encapsulation**
```js
function outer(){
	let x = 1;
	function inner() {
		x = x +1;
	}
	return inner;
}

const incrementX = outer();
incrementX(); // x = 2 
incrementX(); // x = 3 
```

## Array Tricks
```js
const array = [1,2,3,3,4,5];
// regular way

const arr2 = Array(100).fill(0);
// create an array w/ 100 elements, fill all with 0
// we can also change the elements with .map() 
const arr2 = Array(100).fill(1).map((_,i)=>i+1);
// counting from 0 to 99, but we can use the spread method 

const arr3 = [...Array(100).keys()];
// not using .keys directly bc it returns an array iterator, which like an array that you can loop over. 
// doesn't provide all of the values directly and instead just methods like "next" to iterate over them 
//
// basically you can use '...' to convert an iterator to an array 


// get all unique items in an array
const unique = new Set(arr);
	// Set only holds unique values
	// currently is a Set but w/ ... =>
const unique = [...new Set(arr)];
	// converted back into an array 
```

most common way to use an array is to loop over it 

```js
for (const val of arr){
 
}
// usual way to go about it - works for most case```
```

in some cases, you will also need the index of that element, so loop over **array entries**
- each **entry** = is an array itself that contains *index* and *value*
	- can de-structure it
```js
for (const [i,val] of arr.entries()) { 
	console.log(i,val);
	}
```

JS has declarative functional code
- obj can have built-in methods
	- `arr.forEach()`
