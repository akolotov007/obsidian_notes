## DDoS attack
- cloudflare is good option given you use their domain service

## static performance
- CDN services
	- content delivery networks
		- servers placed around the world that cache things like static assets closer to the end user
	- cloudflare has one for free
	- Vultr has one paid 
	- AWS cloudfront

## dynamic perf
- caching the database, 
	- becomes slower as database grows
- ![[Pasted image 20240830132635.png]]
	- can duplicate data from SQL database into a in-memory key value store like Redis
		- allows to keep the most urgent data directly in memory instead of re-running the same SQL query to fetch that data from disk


## scaling up
- scaling vertically = VPS
- scaling horizontially 

## what about containers
- using docker 
	- can take entire config of server and represent it in a docker file
		- docker file is used to make a docker image, 
			- which can run the app as a docker container
- orchestrated using Kubernetes

## automation tools
- Coolify
	- " Kubernetes for babies"
	- instead of doing everything manually, 
		- allows you to connect to a git repo
			- when you push changes, its auto deployed to the VPS

## disaster recovery 
- probably already have backup options from provider, 
	- but what about user data?
		- pocketbase has option to zip user data

what if host decides to shutdown your app?
- we did all config options manually, not really repeatable
	- use a "infrastructure as a code tool" 
		- like Ansible
