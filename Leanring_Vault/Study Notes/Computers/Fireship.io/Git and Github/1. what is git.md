git is used for keeping track of project changes

Repo - track the diff changes to your code base

commit - a snapshot of the code
- has unique ID in order to be able to go back to previous snapshot

git add  = add to a repo

git commit = commit changes, with message indicating what you changed to the code

git branch = create an alternate history for you code
-  git checkout {branch_name} = goto that branch 

git merge {branch_name}  = merge the alternate history to main branch
 - combine branches into a single codebase
