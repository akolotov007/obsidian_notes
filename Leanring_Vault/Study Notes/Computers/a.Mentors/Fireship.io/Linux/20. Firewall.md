first line of defense, make sure to think about what ports should be open and closed

## NginX
- reverse proxy 
- `sudo apt install nginx`
- `systemctl start nginx` 
	- systemctl = used to start and stop services in the background
- `systemctl enable nginx`
	- make *nginx *run in the background 
- `systemctl status nginx`
	- check to make sure that *nginx* is working

## UFW
- uncomplicated fire wall 
- `ufw status`
	- show which ports are open on the server
- `sudo ufw app list`
	- preconfiged options to choose from 

make sure to connect via HTTP since HTTPS needs and SSL Certificate and we haven't made that yet
