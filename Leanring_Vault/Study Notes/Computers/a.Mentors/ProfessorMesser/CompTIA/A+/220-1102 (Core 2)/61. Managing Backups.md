- #####  incredibly important 
	- recover important and valuable data
	- plan for disaster'
- ##### many diff implementations 
	- total amount of data
	- type of backup
	- storage location 
	- backup and recovery software
	- day of the week

## full backup
- ##### backup everything
	- all OS and user files
- ##### usually the longest backup process
- ##### might be impractical every day
	- long backup times
	- lots of storage

## Differential backup
- a full backup is taken first
- subsequent backups contain data changed since last full 
	- usually grows larger as the data has changed

## incremental backup
 - full backup is taken first
 - subsequent backups contain data changed since last full
	 - usually smaller than full backup
- restoration requires full and ALL incremental backups

## Synthetic backup
- ##### create a full backup
	- without preforming full backup
- ##### synthetic backup
	- first full backup copies every file
	- subsequent full backups are created from previous backups
- ##### can be faster and less bandwidth intensive
	- advantage of full backup
	- efficiency of incremental

## backup types
![[Pasted image 20240825164523.png]]


## backup testing
- not enough to preform the backup
	- you have to be able to restore
- ##### disaster recovery testing
	- simulate a disaster situation 
	- restore from a backup
- ##### confirm the restoration
	- test the restored app and data
- ##### preform public audits
	- always have a good backup
	- weekly, monthly, quarterly check
## onsite vs offsite backups
- ##### on site backups
	- no internet link required
	- data is immediately available
	- generally less expensive than off site
- ##### off site
	- transfer data over internet or WAN link
	- data is available after disaster
	- restoration can be preformed from anywhere
- ##### organizations often used both
	- more copies of the data
	- more options when restoring 

## grandfather-father-son (GFS)
- ##### three separate backup rotations
	- monthly, weekly, daily
- ##### twelve monthly full backups (grandfather)
	- good choice for offsite storage
- ##### 4 or 5 weekly full backups (father)
	- depends on which day of the month is selected
- ##### 31 daily incremental or differential backups (son)

## 3-2-1 backup rule
- a popular and effective backup strat
	- for business or home use
- ##### 3 copies of data should always be available
	- 1 primary copy and 2 backups
- ##### 2 diff media types should be used
	- local drive, tape, NAS
- ##### 1 copy of backup should be offsite
	- offsite storage, cloud backup
