## Effective social engineering 
- constantly changing 
-  may involve multiple people
	- and multiple organizations
- may be in person or electronic
	- phone calls from aggressive "customers"
	- emailed funeral notifications of friend or associate

## Phishing
- social engineering with a touch of spoofing 
	- often by email, text, etc.
- don't be fooled 
	- check URL
- usually there's something not quite right
	- spelling, format, graphics
- Vishing (voice phishing) is done over phone or voicemail
	- caller ID spoofing is common
	- fake security checks or bank updates

## Shoulder surfing
- someone has access to important info 
- surprisingly easy 
	- airports / flights
	- hallway facing monitor
- surf from afar -
	- binoculars / telescopes
		- easy in a big city
	- webcam monitoring 
#### preventing it 
- control your input 
- use privacy filters 
	- amazing how well they work
- keep monitor out of sight

## spear phishing 
- targeting phishing with inside information 
	- makes attack more believable
- spear phishing the CEO is "whaling"
	- targeted phishing with possibility of a large catch
	- the CFO (chief financial officer) is commonly speared
- these executives have direct access to corporate bank accounts
	- attacker would love to have those credentials  

## Tailgating and piggybacking 
- ##### tailgating
	- uses auth person to gain unauthed access to building
		- sneaking through when no one is looking
- ##### piggy backing
	- follows the same process, but auth person is giving consent
		- "hold the door, my hands are full of donut boxes"
- once inside, there's little to stop you
	- most security stops at the border

## Watching tailgating
- policy for visitors
	- you should be able to identify anyone 
- one scan, one person
	-  a matter of policy or mechanically required 
- access control vestibule 
	- you don't have a choice
- don't be afraid to ask (employees)

## Impersonation 
- pretend to be someone you aren't
- use some of those details you got from the dumpster
	- "you can trust me, im from your help desk"
- attack the victim as someone higher in rank
	- office of VP for scamming 
- throw tons of technical details around
	- "catastrophic feedback due to the depolarization of the differential magnometer"


## Dumpster diving 
- important info thrown out with the trash
- gather details that can be used for a diff attack
	- impersonate names, use phone numbers
- timing is important 
	- at the end of month, end of quarter
	- based on pickup schedule

## Wireless evil twins
- evil twin of router
- configure the access point to look like an existing network 
	- same (or similar) SSID, and security settings / captive portal
- may  overpower the existing access point
- wifi hotspots are easy to fool
	- and they're wide open
- encrypt your data
	- HTTPS **and** VPN
