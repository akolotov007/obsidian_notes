## Plaintext passwords
- some applications store passwords in the clear
- don't store passwords as plain text 

## Hashing a password
- hashes represents data as a fixed-length string of text
	- message digest or "fingerprint"
- ##### will not have collision 
	- diff inputs result in diff outputs, no 2 same hashes
- ##### one-way trip
	- impossible to recover the original message from the digest
- common way to store passwords

## password file
- different across OS's and applications
	- diff hash

*Linux machine*

## Brute force
- try every possible combination 
- may take some time
	- a strong hashing algorithm slows things down
#### brute force - online
- keep trying login process
- very slow
- most accounts will lockout after certain number of failed attempts
- #### brute force offline
	- obtain a list of users and passwords
	- calculate password hash, 
		- compare to stored hash
	- large computational resource requirement

## Dictionary Attacks
- use dictionary to find common words
	- created by humans
- many common wordlists available on the 'net
	- some passwords are customized by language or line of work
- password crackers can substitute letters
	- p&ssw0rd
- takes time
	- distributed cracking / GPU cracking is common
