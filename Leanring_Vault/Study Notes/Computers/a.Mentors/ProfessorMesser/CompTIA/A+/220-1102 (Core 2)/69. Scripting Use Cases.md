## basic automation 
- ##### automate tasks
	- monitor and resolve problems before they happen
- ##### the need for speed
	- script is a fast as computer
- ##### automate mundane tasks
	- you can do something more creative

## restarting machines
- *an important task*
- ##### app updates
- ##### security patches
- #####  troubleshooting

## remapping network drives
- ##### shared network drives
	- link btwn user and their data
- ##### common task during startup
	- login scripts provide the connection
- ##### automate software changes
	- map drive to the repository
- ##### add or move user data
	- automate the process

## application installations
- ##### install apps automatically
	- many apps have automated installation process
		- scripting makes this hands-off
- ##### on-demand or automatic install scripts

	- install app wo/ user prompts
	- disconnect drive
	- restart system

## automated backups
- ##### usually preformed at night or during off-hours
	- get copy of all important data

- script it 

## info gathering
- ##### get specific info from a remote drive
	- monitoring and reporting
- ##### performance monitor
	- confirm proper operation of a device
- ##### inventory management 
	- check the hardware or software config
- ##### security and vulnerability checkcsa
	- check for certain application or library versions
	- plan for latest patch

## initiating updates

## other scripting considerations
- ##### unintentionally introducing malware
	- make sure you know what your installing
- ##### inadvertently changing system settings
	- test all updates, track file and registry changes
- ##### browser or system crashes
	- mishandling of resources
	- a single character in a script can have unintended consequences
	- always have a backup
	- always test before deployment
