## DNS Server (Domain name system) 
- converts names IP address
	- and vice versa
- distributed naming system 
	-  load  balanced across many diff servers
- usually managed by the ISP or enterprise IT dept
- Critical Resource


## DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
- automatic IP address configuration
- Very common service
	- available on most home routers
- Enterprise DHCP will be redundant 
	- usually running on central servers

## File Server
- centralized storage
- Standard system of file management
	-  SMB (server message block) - windows
	- AFP (apple filing protocol) - apple
	- etc.
- Front-end hides protocol

## Print Server
- connect printer to network
	- provides printer to all network devices
- May be a software in computer
	- computer is connected to the printer 
		- other computers comm to this computer
- May be built-in to the printer
	- network adapter and software
- uses standard printing protocol
	- SMB (server message block)
	- IPP (internet printing protocol)
	- LPD (line printer daemon)

## Mail Server
- store incoming mail, send outgoing
- usually manage by ISP or enterprise IT dept
- usually one of the most imp services
	- 24/7 

## syslog
- standard message logging
	- diverse system,. consolidated logs
- usually central logging receiver
	- integrated into the SIEM
- requires lots of disk space

## Web Servers
- respond to web requests
	- HTTP/HTTPS
- web pages are stored on the server
	- downloaded from server
	- static pages or built dynamically in real-time

## Authentication Server
- login auth to resources
	- centralized management
- almost always an enterprise service
	- not required at home
- Usually set of redundant servers
	- extremely imp service

## Spam
- unsolicited messages
	- email, forums, etc.
- Various content
	- commercial adverts
	- phishing attempts
- Significant tech issue
	- security concerns

- next gen firewall
	- unified threat management (UTM) / Web security gateway
- URL filter
- Malware inspection
- spam filter
- CSU/DSU
- router, switch
- IDS/IPS 
- Bandwidth shaper
- VPN Endpoint

## Load Balancers
- distribute the load
	- multiple servers
- large scale implementation 
	- web server farms, database farms
- fault tolerance 
	- server outages have no effect
	- very fast convergence
- ### Load Balancer Features
	- configurable load
		- manage across servers
	- TCP offload
		- protocol overhead
	- SSL offload
		- Encrypt/decrypt
	- Caching
		- Fast response
	- prioritization 
	-  Content switching
		- application-centric balancing

## Proxy Server
- an intermediate server
	- client makes request to proxy
	- proxy preforms actual request
	- proxy provides results back to client
- useful features
	- access control, caching, URL filtering, content scanning

## SCADA/ICS
- Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition system 
	- large scale, multi-site industrial control system (ICS)
- PC manages equipement
	- power generation, refining, manufacturing equipment, facilities, industrial, energy, logistics
- Distributed control systems
	- real-time info
	- system control
- Requires extensive segmentation 
	- no access from the outside

## Legacy and embedded system
- #### Legacy system
	- another expression for 'really old'
	- may also be "really important"
	- learning old things can be just as important as learning new things
- ### Embedded systems
	- purpose-built device
	- not usual to have direct access to OS
		- relying on manufacturer to provide support and maintenance 
	- alarm system, door security, time card system

## IoT (Internet of Things) Devices
- applianaces
	- refrigerators
- Smart devices
	- smart speakers respond to voice commands
- air control
	- thermostats
- access 
	- smart doorbells
- may require segmented network
	- limit any security breaches
