## OS technologies
- 32-bit vs 64-bit
	- processor specific
- 32 bit processor can store 2^32 values
- 64 bit processor can store 2^64 values
	- 4 GB vs 12 billion GB 
	- the OS has a max supported value
- hardware drivers are specific to the OS version (32/64)
-  32 => 64
	- 64 =/> 32

## Advanced RISC machine (ARM)
- CPU architecture developed by ARM Ltd.
	- they design the chip, others license and build
- simplified instruction set
	- efficient and fast processing
	- less power
	- less heat
- traditionally used for mobile and IoT devices
	- the line is constantly blurring

## Processor Core
- dual / quad / octa / multi core
	- and more
- multiple cores
	- each has its own cache 
	- the entire chip may have a shared cache

## Multithreading
- hyper-threading technology (HTT)
- one CPU, acts like two
	- doesn't actually work as fast as two
		- 15% - 30% performance improvement 
- OS must be written to support HTT
	- windows XP and later (any modern OS)

## Virtualization support
- run other operating system within a single hardware platform
	- multiple OS share physical hardware components
- virtualization in software was limited 
	- performance and hardware management challenges
- virtualization added to the processor
	- hardware is faster and easier to manage 
	- Intel Virtualization Technology (VT)
	- AMD Virtualization (AMD-V)
