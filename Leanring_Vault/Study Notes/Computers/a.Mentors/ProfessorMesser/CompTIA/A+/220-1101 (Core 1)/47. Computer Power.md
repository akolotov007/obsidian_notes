**Always disconnect from the power source when working on a device 

- some devices store a charge in capacitors 
	- know how to discharge before touching 
- never connect your body to any part of electrical system 
	- don't connect to ground wire
- **respect electricity

## Computer Power Supply
- computer uses DC voltage 
	- most power sources provide AC voltage
- convert 120 V AC or 240 V AC
	- to 3.3 V DC, 5 V DC and 12 V DC

## Amp, Volt, and Watt
- ##### **Ampere** (Amp, A) - the rate of electron flow past a point in 1 second
	- ex. the diameter of the hose
- #####  **Voltage** (volt, V) - electrical "pressure" pushing the electrons
	- ex. how open the faucet it
- ##### **Watt** (W) - measurement of real power use
	- volts * amps = watts
		- 120 V * 0.5 A = 60W

## Current 
- ##### Alternating Current (AC)
	- direction of current constantly reverses 
	- distributes electricity efficiently over long distances
	- frequency of this cycle is important 
		- US/Canada - 110 to 120 volts of AC (VAC), 60 Hz
		- Europe - 220-240 VAC, 50 Hz
			- Hz = times a second
- ##### Direct Current (DC)
	- current moves in one direction with constant voltage

## Dual-Voltage Input Options
- voltage varies by country
	- US/Canada - 120 volts of AC (VAC), 60 Hz
	- Europe - 230 VAC, 50 Hz
- power supply may have switch to manually change between 120 V and 230 V
	- get your meter
	- or use an auto-switching power supply
- **don't plug a 120V power supply into a 230V power source!

## Power Supply Output
- ##### different voltages
	- for diff components
- ##### positive and negative voltage
	- voltage is a difference in potential 
	- the electrical ground is a common reference point
	- depends on where you measure from
- ex: at the front door of your house:
	- the second floor is +10 feet
	- the basement is -10 feet
- ##### + 12V 
	- PCIe adapters, hard drive motors, cooling fans, most modern components
- ##### +5V
	- some motherboard components, although most use 3.3V
- ##### +3.3V
	- M.2 slots, RAM slots, motherboard logic circuits
- ##### +5 VSB
	- standby voltage
		- used in hibernate - constantly checking if power button is pressed
- ##### -12V (older components)
	- integrated LAN
	- older serial ports
	- some PCI cards
- ##### -5V (near obsolete / I say)
	- available for ISA adapters cards
	- most cards didn't use it
		- today motherboards don't have ISA slots

*power supply specs*


[[40. Motherboard connections# 24-pin motherboard connections]] / copied
## 24-pin motherboard connections 
- main motherboard power
	- provides +3.3V , +/- 5V, and +/- 12V
- 20 pin connector was original ATX standard
	- 24 pin was added for PCIe power
- you can connect 24 pin to a 20 pin motherboard
	- some cables are 20-pin + 4-pin

## Redundant power supplies 
- 2 (or more) power supplies
	- internal to the server
-  each power supply can handle 100% of the load
	- would normally run at 50%
- hot-swappable
	- replace faulty power supply wo/ powering down

## Power Supply Connectors
- ##### fixed connectors
	- connected to the power supply
- ##### Modular
	- add cables as needed 
	- fewer leftover cables, better airflow
	- a bit more expensive

*modular power supply. Also exist in hybrid*

## Sizing a power supply
- power supplies are rated by watts
	- overall and individual voltages
- bigger isn't necessarily better
	- more expensive
	- doesn't speed up your computer
- physical size is relatively standard
	- older cases may have proprietary sizes

## Sizing a power supply
- calculate the Watts required for all components
	- CPU, storage devices, video adapter
	- many online calculators
- video adapters are usually the largest power draw
	- many video cards list recommended supply wattage
- 50% capacity is a good rule of thumb 
	- power supple runs efficiently and there's room to upgrade
