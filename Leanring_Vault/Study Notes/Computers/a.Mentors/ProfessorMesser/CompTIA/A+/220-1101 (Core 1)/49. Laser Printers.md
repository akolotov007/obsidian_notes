- combine a laser, high volts, charged ions, powdered ink, heat and paper
	- very high quality
	- fast printing speeds
- very complex 
	- many moving parts
	- requires on-printer memory
	- messy on the inside

## Imaging Drum
- image is drawn onto photosensitive drum
	- "painted" with a laser 
- picks up toner
	- transfers toner to paper
- can be separate from the toner cartridge
	- or combined

## Fuser Assembly 
- heat and pressure 
	- melt plastic toner powder
	- permanently bond toner to paper

## Transfer belt and roller
- color laser printers
	- cyan, yellow, magenta, black
- 4 separate toner cartridge
- image transferred from all cartridges to the single belt 
	- and then to single transfer roller ![[Pasted image 20240806194339.png]]
## Pickup Roller
- pickup paper
	- should be single page at a time
	- problems with paper feed probably is related to this
- should be periodically cleaned / replaced

## Separation Pad
- pull just the top sheet from paper tray
	- not multiple sheets
- small and inexpensive

## Duplex Assembly
- printers usually print on 1 side
- printing on both sides is 2 step process
	- print side 1, print side 2 
- needs mechanisms to "flip" the page 
	- automatically
- can be built-in to the printer
	- or available as an add-on
