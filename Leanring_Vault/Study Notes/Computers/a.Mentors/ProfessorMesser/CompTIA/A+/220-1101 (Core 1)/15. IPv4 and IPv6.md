## IP addressing
- ### IPv4 is the primary protocol for everything
	- included in almost all configurations
- #### IPv6 is also now part of all major OS's
	- backbone of internet infrastructure

## Networking with IPv4
- ### IP address ex: 192.168.1.165
	- every device needs unique IP address
- #### Subnet Mask ex: 255.255.255.0
	- used by local device to determine what subnet it's on
	- subnet mask (usually) transmitted across network
	- You'll ask for the subnet mask all the time
- #### Default Gateway ex: 162.168.1.1
- The router that allows to communicate outside of local subnet
- default gateway must be an IP address on the local subnet

## DNS (Domain Name System)
- we remember names
	- google, youtube etc.
- internet routers don't know names, only addresses
- something has to translate between names and IP addresses
	- DNS does that
- you configure 2 DNS servers in your IP configuration
