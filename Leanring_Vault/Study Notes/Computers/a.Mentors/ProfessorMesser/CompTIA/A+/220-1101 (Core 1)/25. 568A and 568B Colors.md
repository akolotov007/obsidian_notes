## Structured Cabling Standards
- international ISO/IEC 11801 cabling standards
	- defines classes of networking standards
- #### Telecommunications Industry Standard (TIA)
	- standards, market analysis, trade shows, gov affairs, etc.
	- ANSI/TIA-568: commercial building telecommunications cabling standard
- commonly referenced for pin and pair assignments of 8-conductor 100-ohm balanced twisted pair cabling
	- abbreviated as *T568A and T568B*

## T568A and T568B termination
- pin assignments from T568B standard
	- 8-conductor 100-ohm balanced twisted pair cabling
- T568A and T568B are diff pin assignments for 8P8C connectors (8 position, 8 conductor)
	- assigns the T568A pin-out to horizontal cabling
- #### many organizations traditionally use 568B 
- can't terminate one side of cable with T568A and another with T568B
	- never been the definition of Gigabit ethernet crossover cable

- pins 1 & 2, 3 & 6 are changed | 4,5,7,8 remain the same

- some businesses prefer to punch everything with TA instead of TB
	- the punch down block can be marked to show which colors are supposed to go to which
