- many different devices and components
- some functions are combined together
	- wireless router, switch, firewall

## Routers
- forwards traffic between IP subnets
	- makes forwarding decision based on IP address
	- routers inside of switches called "layer 3 switches"
- Often connects diverse network types:
	- LAN, WAN, copper, fiber
- forwards traffic based on the destination IP address that's within a packet

## Switches
- determines where traffic should be forwarded based on the destination MAC address
- bridging done in hardware - copper cable plugged in laptop or desktop
	- application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC)
	- forwards traffic based on data link address
- many ports and features 
	- the core of an enterprise network
	- may provide Power of Ethernet (PoE)
- multilayer switch 
	- includes routing functionality 

## Unmanaged Switches
- very few configuration options
	- plug and play
- Fixed configuration
	- no VLANs
- Very little integration with other devices
	- no management protocols
- low price point
	- simple is less expensive

## Managed Switches
 - #### VLAN support
	- interconnect with other switches via 802.1Q
- #### traffic prioritization 
	- voice traffic gets a higher priority
- #### Redundancy support
	- spanning tree protocol (STP)
- #### Port Mirroring
	- capture packets
	- take traffic from one port and copy traffic to diff port 
		- plug in protocol analyzer to view all packets
- #### External Management
	- simple network management protocol (SNMP)\

## Access Point
- not a wireless router
	- a wireless router is a _router_ and an _access point_ in 1 device
- #### Access point is a bridge
	- extends the wired network onto the wireless network
	- makes forwards decisions based on MAC address

## Cable Infrastructure
![[Pasted image 20240714213417.png]]
#### Patch Panels
- combinations of punch-down blocks and RJ-45 connectors
- runs from desks are made once
	- permanently punched down to patch panel
- patch panel to switch can be easily changed 
	- no special tools
	- using existing cables
![[Pasted image 20240714220222.png]]
## Firewall
- filters traffic by port number | OSI layer 4 (TCP/UDP)
	- some firewalls can filter based on the application 
- #### can encrypt traffic into/out of the network
	- protect your traffic btwn sites
- #### can proxy traffic
	- a common security technique 
- #### most firewalls can be layer 3 devices (routers)
	- usually sits on the ingress/egress of the network
![[Pasted image 20240714220238.png]]
## Power over Ethernet (PoE)
- one wire for both network and electricity 
- phones, cameras wireless access points
- useful in difficult to power areas
- #### Power provided at the switch
	- built in power - endspans
	- in-line power injector - midspans 
		- injects power at in between of wire

## PoE switch
- commonly marked on the switch or interfaces
- Blue line shows which ports are PoE 
![[Pasted image 20240714214612.png]]
## PoE (+, ++)
- #### PoE: IEEE 802.3af-2003
	- the original PoE specs
	- now part of the 802.3 standard
	- 15.4 watts DC power, 350 mA max current
- #### PoE+: IEEE 802.3at-2009
	- now also part of the 802.3 standard 
	- 25.5 watts DC power, 600 mA max current
- ### PoE++: IEEE 802.bt-2018
	- 51 W (type 3), 600 mA max current
	- 71.3 W (type4), 960 mA max current 
	- PoE with 10GBASE-T

## Hub
- "Multi port repeater"
	- traffic going in one port is repeated to every other port
- Everything is half-duplex
- becomes less efficient as network traffic increases 
- 10 megabit / 100 megabit
	- difficult to find today, old
![[Pasted image 20240714220309.png]]
## Cable Modem
- _used for internet connectivity 
- Broadband
	- transmission across multiple frequencies
	- different traffic types
- data on the "cable" network
	- DOCSIS (Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification	)
- High-Speed networking
	- speeds up to 1 Gigabit/s are available
- Multiple Services
	- data, voice, video
![[Pasted image 20240714220329.png]]
##  DSL Modem
- ADSL (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line)
	- uses telephone lines
- Download Speed is faster than the upload speed 
	- ~10,000 foot limitation from the central office (CO)
	- 52 M bits/s downstream / 16 M bits/s upstream are common
	- faster speeds may be possible if closer to the CO
![[Pasted image 20240714220339.png]]
## ONT (Optical Network Terminal)
- fiber to the premises 
- connect the ISP fiber network to the copper network
	- demarcation point (demarc) in the data center
	- terminal box on the side of the building 
- Line of responsibility
	- one side of the box is the ISP
	- other side of the box is your network
![[Pasted image 20240714220352.png]]
## Network Interface Card (NIC)
- the fundamental network device
	- every device on the network has a NIC
		- computers, servers, printers, routers, switches, phones, tablets, cameras, etc.
- Specific to the network type
	- Ethernet, WAN, wireless , etc.
- Often built-in to the motherboard
	- or added as an expansion card 
- Many options
	- single port, multi-port, copper, fiber
