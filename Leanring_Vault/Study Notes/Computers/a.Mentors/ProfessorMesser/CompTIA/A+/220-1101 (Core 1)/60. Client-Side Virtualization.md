## Virtualization 
- one computer, many OS's
- Host based virtualization 
	- your normal desktop plus others
- standalone server that hosts VM's
	- enterprise level
- been around 1967
	- IBM mainframe virtualization 

## Legacy software and OS
- need to run diff application versions on the same system
	- run each application instance in separate VM
- application only runs on previous OS version 
	- create VM with older OS

## Cross-platform virtualization 
- each OS has strengths/ weaknesses 
- run diff OS at the same time
	- move btwn them with ease
- save time and resources 
	- one physical computer

## The hypervisor 
- #####  aka Virtual Machine Manager
	- manages the virtual platform and guest OS
- ##### may require a CPU that supports virtualization
	- can improve performance
- ##### hardware management 
	- CPU
	- networking
	- security
## Resource Requirements
- ##### CPU processor support 
	- intel: virtualization technology (VT)
	- AMD: AMD-V
- ##### Memory (RAM)
	- above and beyond host OS requirements
- ##### Disk Space
	- each guest OS has own image
- ##### Network
	- configurable on each OS
	- virtual switch

## Sandboxing
- ##### isolated tested environment
	- no connection to the real world or production system
	- technological safe space
- ##### virtualize development process
	- try some code, break some code, nothing gets hurt
- ##### additional development features
	- roll back to previous snapshot
	- run additional systems

## Building a application 
- ##### Develop
	- secure environment
	- writing code
	- develop test in their sandboxes
- ##### Test
	- separate virtual env for testing
	- still in development stage

## Hypervisor Security
- hypervisor is a sweet spot for bad guys
- ##### VM escaping
	- malware 
		- recognizes its on a VM
		- compromises the hypervisor
		- jumps from one guess OS to another
- many hosted services are virtual environments 
	- malware can gather customer's info from server

## Guest OS security
- every guest is self-contained
	- like a real computer
- use traditional security controls
	- host-based firewall
	- anti-virus, anti-spyware
- watch out for rogue VM's
	- bad guys try to install their own system
- self-contained VM provided by 3rd party can be dangerous
	- no idea what is running on there 

## Network requirements
- most client-side VM managers have their own internal (virtual) network
- ##### shared network address
	- VM uses same IP as host 
	- uses a private IP address internally
	- uses NAT (network address translation ) to convert to physical host IP
- ##### Bridged network address
	- the VM is a device on the physical network
- ##### Private Address
	- the VM does not communicate outside of virtual network
