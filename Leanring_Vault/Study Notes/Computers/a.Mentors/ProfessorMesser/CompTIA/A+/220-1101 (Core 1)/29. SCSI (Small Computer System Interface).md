## SCSI
- originally designed to string many peripherals together onto a single cable/controller
	- up to 16 devices in a SCSI "chain"
- Many Different Formats![[Pasted image 20240730172807.png]]
## SCSI Standard
-  not just for hard drives
	- scanners, tape drives, CD-ROM drives
- many devices on a single bus
	- 8 on narrow bus, 16 on wide bus
- very intelligent interface functionality 
	- much of the difficult config work is done btwn SCSI devices
- Industry Longevity 
	- well supported in the enterprise 
	- a standard drive for virtual systems

## SCSI ID and logical unit (LUN)
- Every SCSI device on a single bus is assigned a separate ID number 
	- SCSI ID 0 (controller), ID 2 (hard drive), ID 3 (CD-ROM)
- logical units (LUNs) are defined within each SCSI ID
	- separate drive in a storage array or VM
- the signal at the "end" of a physical SCSI bus is terminated
	- can be internal to the device or separate termination device
- Serial attached SCSI (SAS) devices 
	- have no jumpers, terminators, or settings
	- newer and easier to use

## Serial attached SCSI
- Moving from parallel to serial 
	- increased throughput
	- similar to the move from PATA to SATA
- Point to Point 
	- no daisy chain 
- no termination required
	- bus has 2 devices 
- the control and management of SCSI 
	- the speed of a serial connection

	- *2.5" SAS drive, looks similar to SATA
