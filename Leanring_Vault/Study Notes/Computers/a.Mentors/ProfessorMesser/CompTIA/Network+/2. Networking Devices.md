- ##### Many diff ways to forward traffic
	- data center full of equipment 
- ##### every device has a purpose
	- implementation may change over time
	- once installed, can often be difficult to remove
- new tech all the time

## Router
- ##### routes traffic between IP subnets
	- OSI layer 3
	- routers inside of switches sometimes called "layer 3 switches"
- layer 2  Data link - Switch
- layer 3  Network - router
- ##### often connect diverse network types
	- LAN, WAN, copper, fiber

## Switch
- ##### bridging done in hardware
	- application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) 
- ##### layer 2 data link device 
	-  forwards traffic based on data link address
- ##### many ports and features
	- core of an enterprise network
	- may provide power over ethernet 
- ##### multilayer switch
	- if includes routing functionality 

## Firewall
- filter traffic by port number or application 
- ##### Encrypt traffic
	- VPN
- ##### most can be layer 3 devices (routers)
	- often sits on ingress/egress of the network
	- Network address translation (NAT)
	- dynamic routing

## IDS and IPS
- ##### Intrusion Detection System / Intrusion Prevention system
	- watch the network traffic
- ##### Intrusions
	-  exploits, buffer overflows, cross site scripting, etc.
- ##### Detection vs Prevention
	- Detection  - Alarm / alert
	- Prevention - Stop it before it gets into the network


## Balancing the load / Load Balancers
- ##### distribute the load
	- multiple servers
- ##### large scale implementations
	- web server farms
- ##### fault tolerance
	- server outages have no effect 
	- fast convergence
- ##### Configurable Load
	- manage across servers
- ##### TCP offload
	- protocol overhead
	- connection occurring as quick as possible 
- #####  SSL Offload
	- Encryption / Decryption 
	- load balancer will take care of it, not individual servers
- ##### Caching
	- fast response
- ##### Prioritization 
	-  QoS (quality of service)
- ##### content switching 
	- application centric balancing

## Proxies
- ##### sits btwn user and external network
	- receives user request and sends the request on their behalf 
- useful for caching info, access control, URL filtering, content scanning
- Applications may need to know how to use the proxy (explicit)
	- some proxies are invisible (transparent)

## NAS vs. SAN 
- ##### Network Attached Storage (NAS)
	- connect to a shared storage device across the network
	- file level access
- ##### Storage Area Network (SAN)
	- looks and feels like local storage device
		- block level access
	- very efficient reading and writing
- ##### Both require a lot of bandwidth
	- may use an isolated and high-speed network

## Access point (AP)
- not a wireless router
	- *wireless router is a router and an access point on a single device*
- ##### access point is a bridge
	- extends the wired network onto wireless network
	- OSI layer 2 - Data Link

## wireless networks are everywhere
- your access points may not even be in the same building
- configs may change at any moment
	- access policy, security policy, AP configs
- ##### The network should be invisible to your users
	- seamless network access, regardless of role

## wireless LAN controllers
- ##### centralized management of access points
	- deploy new access points
	- performance and security monitoring
	- config and deploy changes to all sites
