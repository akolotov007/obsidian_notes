Fundamental Concepts of OOP
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_MQYyJpIjg
## Procedural Programming
- programming with a focus on procedures/functions that preform specific tasks.

## OOP programming
- programming centered around *objects* rather than functions
	- **objects** = a thing from the real world
		- a thing that you want to store and process data about

- emphasis on modularity, reusability, and abstraction.

### abstraction
- to simplify the complex things  
- abstracting the lower level details, focusing on higher-level concepts such as objects and inheritance  

### encapsulation
- data is within the objects, such as having a function within an object
### Inheritance
- classes can inherit properties from parent classes, reducing redundant code
### polymorphism
- "many forms"
- a class can implement an inherited method in its own way
- refactors ugly switch/case statements
