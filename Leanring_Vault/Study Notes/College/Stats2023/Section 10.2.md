## Correlation and Regression 
- finding the equation of the straight line that best fits the points in a scatterplot of paired sample data

**Regression Line** -  given a collection of paired sample data, the regression line is the straight line that "best" fits the scatterplot of the data

### Regression Equation
$$\hat{y} = b_0+b_1x$$
x  = indep. variable
y = dep. variable


### Finding the Equation of the Regression Line


| of regression line | Sample Statistic   | Population Parameter       |
| ------------------ | ------------------ | -------------------------- |
| y-intercept        | $b_0$              | $\beta_0$                  |
| slope              | $b_1$              | $\beta_1$                  |
| equation           | $\hat{y}=b_0+b_1x$ | $\hat{y}=\beta_0+\beta_1x$ |
### Requirements
- sample of paired data (x,y) is a random sample of quantitative data
- visual examination of the scatterplot shows that the points approx a straight line pattern*
- outliers can have a strong effect of the regression equation, so remove any outliers if they are known to be errors. *

- 2 & 3 are simplified attempts at checking these formal requirements for regression analysis

- for x,  y values all have the same standard deviation 
- for x, y values have means that lie along the same straight line

#### Rounding the slope and y intercept
- 3 sig figures. 


### Example
Use technology to find the equation of the regression line in which the explanatory variable (or x variable) is the amount of the lottery jackpot and the response variable (or y variable) is the corresponding number of lottery tickets sold. (Jackpot amounts are in millions of dollars and numbers of tickets sold are in millions.)



| Jackpot | Tickets |
| ------- | ------- |
| 334     | 54      |
| 127     | 16      |
| 300     | 41      |
| 227     | 27      |
| 202     | 23      |
| 180     | 18      |
| 164     | 18      |
| 145     | 16      |
| 255     | 26      |
