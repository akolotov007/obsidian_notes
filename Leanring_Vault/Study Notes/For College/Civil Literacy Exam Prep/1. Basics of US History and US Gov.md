			- *"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal... and have 'certain unalienable rights;' government is created to protect these rights. All are born with these rights ("endowed by their creator")"*
		- rights to **Life**, **Liberty** and the **Pursuit of Happiness**

## Founding the US 
- #### articles of confederation 
	- original plan for the US gov but *did not have a strong enough national government*

## Federalist Papers
- 85 essays written to support the passage of US constitution
