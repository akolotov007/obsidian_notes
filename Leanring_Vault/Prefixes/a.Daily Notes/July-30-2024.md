Bio online just finished, Spanish II is going to finish this friday.

I'll do the 12 videos today (2 missed since last time and 10 today) 
- checked out the stack overflow 2024 annual survey, very insightful 
	- showed which dev languages are popular, along with rarity of knowing certain languages 
	- pay info 
	- which services are being used: cloud services, monitoring tickets, etc 
	- most are complacent at their jobs, which sounds like ass ngl
		- too complex code to work with is the most common issue devs face
