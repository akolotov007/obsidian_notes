there a lot of things that I want to learn but realizing that I am not doing anything to learn them
Damn.
the only real focus is security, network, A+, and linux additionally 
I really could go through **network** and **security** at the same time

contacts are pissing me off again, I double washed and everything
- either I have buildup on my eyes (idk)
- either my eyes are tired of contacts
- either the contacts' edges are hitting my eyes too much and I can't handle it

but
- I've worn contacts for years
- ive worn daily and monthly with no problems such as this
- Fresh solution every night
- wash hands prior to putting them on

Still
- having this sensation all around the iris that the contact are pissing me off

im just going to put them into the solution and wait a bit, or take them off sooner than bedtime

need to get glasses ASAP

also I just thought of this, my eyes could also not be properly cleaning themselves in the process., slowly getting used to having contacts in my eyes

I cant see the letters on the screen either, I'm just writing all that I can - as if I were blind folded.
