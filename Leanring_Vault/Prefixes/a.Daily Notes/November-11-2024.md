I haven't written a note in a while, 
I've been working a lot of hours as a server assistant and barely have any time to do homework
even less time to study on my own what I want to do 

I have 2 classes that I need to finish at BCC and then get some classes in FIU.
- getting an advising appointment has got to be the most annoying thing ever


I have intro to programming hw that I need to finish
