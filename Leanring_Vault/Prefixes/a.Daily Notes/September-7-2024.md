Used the codewithmosh cheatsheet for C++ to finish out the "intro to C++" notes.
wifi is being shit today, looks like a link in the network isn't working properly and keeps dropping packets.

I wanted to continue with OOP in C++, and I also need to know how to read/write files with C++ (for the class) 

I have a C++ book that I can read and look into... might do that
