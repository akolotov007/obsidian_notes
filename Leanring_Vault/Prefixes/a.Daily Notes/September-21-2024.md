man idk, I've been focusing on JS for a while, about time that I should make a simple project.
async/await  - i think im getting it, but I haven't learned too much about the event loop

C++ and C I need to come back to...
Java too since it develops from C++

so that's :
1. python 
2. Java 
3. C++
4. C 
5. JavaScript
